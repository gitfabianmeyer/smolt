fiscal uniformity Fiscal uniformity advantages disadvantages advantages An excellent summary advantages concerning uniform fiscal coordinated fiscal calendars contained paper public finance authority recently He listed values fiscal uniformity 1 The uniform fiscal requires compliance common sense administration local finances adoption budget financial plan advance spending 2 The uniform fiscal ensures conformance common sense rule cash bank checks drawn It enables towns economical purchases advantage cash discounts 3 The uniform fiscal promotes careful budgeting strengthens control expenditures By fixing tax rate advance spending upper limits set expenditures 4 The uniform fiscal brings town fiscal line schools expend largest share local disbursements This greatly simplifies town bookkeeping financial reporting 5 The uniform fiscal eliminates charges money borrowed form tax anticipation notes Furthermore tax collections immediately current expenditures invested short-term treasury notes augmenting town miscellaneous revenues reducing tax levy 6 The uniform fiscal facilitates inter-town comparison revenues expenditures When towns fiscal relatively easy meaningful comparisons nd cost local government increases demand comparison increases Towns fiscal difficult compare Of advantages probably none elimination tax anticipation notes Borrowing anticipation current taxes revenues routine procedure majority municipalities times It bank loans sale notes warrants somewhat casual method issuance registration warrants In event form borrowing rendered unnecessary Its elimination result saving costs heavy short-term money rates freedom dependence credit available This type borrowing reduced minimum quarterly installment payment taxes instituted payment placed near fiscal Any approach system looks saving security It noted equally reasons establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases uniform fiscal Both federal governments commence fiscal July 1 Both units government contribute increasingly sums money local governments indicated It local government revenues produced locally property tax lack uniform fiscal handicap ut growth federal fiscal aid emphasis equalization state-local sharing responsibility functions true The haphazard fiscal calendar obstacle planning efficient state-local revenue expenditure relationships Disadvantages Although
