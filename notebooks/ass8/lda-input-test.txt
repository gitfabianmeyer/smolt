	Draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower Pennsylvania . Any house built now below that line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10 years . Fortunately , it is the FHA which has arrived at this conclusion , for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage , and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress . Even if you live above that line , the FHA will back you , for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged .	New simplified packaged units , recently devised prefabricated glass-fiber ducts , and improved add-on techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as little as $600 to $900 . Two men can often do the installation in a day . You can install it yourself -- this is a central system that will cool every part of your house . Its upkeep ? ? No less an authority than the FHA concurs that the savings air conditioning makes possible more than offset its operating costs . Is it worth-while ? ?Home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted . We know now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually desirable , and accurate controls assure the comfort we want .	We know , too , that health is never harmed by summer cooling . On the contrary , there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills . The filtered air benefits allergies , asthma , sinus , hay fever . Control of temperature and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid . Heart conditions and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive heat .	Housekeeping is easier . The cleaner air means less time spent pushing a vacuum , fewer trips to the dry cleaners , lighter loads for the washing machine . The need for reupholstering , redecorating , repainting becomes more infrequent . Clothes hold their shape better , and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words .	It will improve your disposition . When you ' re less fatigued , things just naturally look brighter . The children can have their daytime naps and hot meals , and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms . You ' ll sleep longer and better , too , awake refreshed and free of hot weather nerves .	You can forget about screens , and leave the storm windows up all year around .	Best of all , central air conditioning is something you can afford . Like its long-lived cousin , the refrigerator , a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years or more . That brings its per-year cost down mighty low . For any house .No matter what style your home is , ranch , two-story , Colonial or contemporary , central air conditioning is easily installed . The equipment won ' t take up valuable space either . It can go in out-of-the-way waste space .	But there ' s no denying that the easiest and most economical way to get year-' round whole-house air conditioning is when you build . If that ' s done , the house can be designed and oriented for best operation , and this can mean savings both in the size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself .	If you can ' t see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building , by all means make provision for its easy adding later . Manufacturers have designed equipment for just such circumstances , and your savings over starting from scratch will be substantial .	If your house is to have a forced warm air system , cooling can be a part of it . This costs less than having a completely separate cooling system , for your regular heating ductwork , filters and furnace blower do double duty for cooling . You can get year-' round air conditioners in the same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone -- high or low boy , horizontal or counterflow . The units can be installed in basement , attic , crawlspace , or in a closet located in the living area . The cooling coil is located in the furnace ' s outlet . From the coil small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set in the yard , garage , carport , or basement .	If you plan to add cooling later to your heating system , there are things to watch for . Be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed . They may be inaccessible later . Be sure your ducts and blower are big enough to handle cooling . This is especially important if you live in a mild-winter zone . Be sure you get a perimeter heating system , and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for heating .	You can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house . For cooling , chilled water is circulated instead of hot water . Instead of radiators you ' ll have cooling-heating units , each with its own thermostat . These systems are more expensive than year-' round forced air systems . The minimum cost for an average one-story , 7-room house with basement , is likely to run $1500 above the cost of the heating alone . Separate systems .If the problems of combining cooling with your heating are knotty , it may be cheaper to plan on a completely separate cooling system . The simplest kind of separate system uses a single , self-contained unit . It is , in effect , an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts to distribute the cooled , cleaned , dehumidified air where it is wanted .	In a long , rambling ranch , two such units can be installed , one serving the living area , the other the sleeping zone . In a two-story house , one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first floor , another in the attic to cool the second . In each case , having separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of permitting individual zone control . The heat pump .One of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched to heating . As you know , a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors . A relatively simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine literally runs backward , and the heat is extracted from outdoor air and turned indoors .	Up until recently , this heat pump method of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when outside temperatures were above 40 degrees . Now , the machine has been improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures down to 15 degrees . You can get this added heating feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone .	Consider it as a standby setup , at negligible cost , for those emergencies when the furnace quits , a blizzard holds up fuel delivery , or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don ' t want to start up your whole heating plant . What size conditioner ? ?How large a cooling unit you need , and the method of its installation , depends on a variety of factors . Among other things , besides the nature of your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from the outside , it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup of your family . Families with children usually don ' t want the house quite so cool . If you are a party thrower , you may need added capacity . The body is a heat machine , and 20 to 25 guests can easily double your cooling load .	Cooling requirements are best expressed in terms of Aj . A BTU is a unit of heat , and the BTU rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can pump out of your house in an hour . A very rough rule of thumb is that , under favorable conditions , you ' ll need 15 BTU ' s of cooling for every square foot of your house . This is if outdoor temperatures have a high average of 95 degrees . You ' ll need more if the high average is above that , less if it ' s below .	Coolers are also rated by tons . A ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by melting a ton of ice . By accepted definition , a 1-ton conditioner will provide 12 , 000 BTU of cooling in one hour .	You may find a conditioner rated by horsepower . It is generally an inaccurate method of rating , for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor , and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you ' ll get . A 1-hp conditioner , for example , may vary in effectiveness from under 8 , 000 BTU to well over 10 , 000 Aj .	The safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need , rather than trying to do this yourself .	Don ' t urge your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough . Better to have your equipment slightly undersized than too big . Here ' s why : 	Reducing humidity is often as important as cooling . An oversize unit will cool off your house quickly , then shut down for a long period . Before it cycles on again , humidity can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature is still low . With a unit of the right size , a compressor will run continuously during hot weather , reducing humidity as evenly as it does temperature . Money-saving tips .Attention to details can cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately . A well-designed , 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled and heated for as little as $128 a year , or $11 a month .	If you have a house which heat doesn ' t penetrate easily , your unit will have less heat to remove . Keep the direct sun from reaching the house and you ' ve won the first battle . In a new house , generous roof overhangs are a logical and effective solution . If the house you plan to buy or build won ' t have big overhangs , you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed trellises , fences and awnings .	Shade trees , too , are a big help , so keep them if you can . Drawn blinds and draperies do some good , but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house .	The more directly the sun strikes walls and roof , the greater its heat impact . The way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you ' re going to need . A shift in the walls , or a change in the roof slope , so the sun hits them more obliquely , can save you money .	You can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun , double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation . Restrict large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house . They ' re easier to shade there . An attic space above insulation makes a house easier to cool . You ' ll even gain by putting your water heater outside the conditioned space , and using an electric range instead of a gas one . Gas adds to the moisture load .	Insulate , weatherstrip , double-glaze to the maximum . In insulation , the numbers to remember are 6-4-2 . They stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation in the ceiling , 4 inches in the side walls , 2 inches in the floors . Such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling installation , but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in heating and cooling . A light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50 per cent .	It costs two to three times as much to remove a BTU in summer as it does to add one in winter , so every solitary BTU is worth attention . You ' ll foil them in droves , along with their pal humidity , by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan , a bathroom ventilator for when you shower , and an outside vent for the clothes drier . Keeping conditioners quiet .It ' s no use pretending that all conditioners are quiet , but the noise they produce can be kept to a minimum . Good workmanship is important in the installation , so if you ' re doing your own contracting , don ' t award the job on the basis of price alone .	Avoid attic placement directly above a bedroom .
Most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning . This is particularly true in site selection . You must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are ; ; you must have a list of requirements on where , how many , and what type sites are needed . With such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available .	Begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible . These are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies . The new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site . These are inexpensive and available from the U . S . Geological Society , Washington 25 , D . C . . In recent years many counties and the U . S . Forest Service have taken aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning use . Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor ' s office showing ownerships of land .	Inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation . This gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions , the exposure to the sun and wind , the water interests , etcetera , which vary greatly with the seasons . It is usually helpful to make a sketch map in the field , showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site . These are a great aid for planning use back at the office .For site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry through the study . However , there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation . County judges , commissioners , engineers , assessors , and others who have lived in the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences . A visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area .	How much study is required ? ? This , of course , depends on the character of the site itself , the previous experience of the investigator , and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision . It is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick judgment of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone . Usually there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions . A site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little development or water . The same is true of areas which at first look good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually be poor areas to develop for general public use .	In looking for the best sites available that meet the requirements , you need information to compare the site with others . You need answers to four important questions .	What are the existing recreation features ? ?	How well can the site be developed ? ?	How useful will it be to the public ? ?	Is this site available ? ?	Check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests already existing at the site . Naturally , a park site with scenic views , a good lake , trees , and sand dunes , will attract more people than a nearby area with only trees and dunes . Quality is vitally important . Frontage on a body of clear , clean water will be vastly different from the same amount of frontage on polluted water . Some recreation features , such as scenic values and water interest , also have greater overall value than other interests .	One of the most desirable features for a park are beautiful views or scenery . It may be distant views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a small lake , colorful rock formations , or unusual trees . A site which overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic . An area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf rolling in on a beach . A site may also be attractive just through the beauty of its trees and shrubs . Note extent of these interests and how available they will be for the public to enjoy .	Water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site . Most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas . This follows naturally since frontage on an ocean , stream , or lake provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation activities of bathing , fishing , boating , and other water sports . A body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract the greatest picnic and camping use . It also cools the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wild life .	The amount of water frontage , the quantity and quality of the water , and the recreation afforded by it are important . A restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use . The quantity of water flow may be critical ; ; a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer . If the site is on a reservoir , the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied . Check the quality of the water . A stream which has all of its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area . Other factors , such as water temperature , depth of water , the fish life it supports , wave action , flooding , etcetera , will affect its recreation value .Other natural features which can be of high interest are the forests , canyons , mountains , deserts , seacoast , beaches , sand dunes , waterfalls , springs , etcetera with which the area is blessed . Just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which are of national or state significance , counties should seek out these features which are distinctive of their area . Although the site may not contain the features themselves , there are often opportunities to include them as additional interest to the site . The route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them . A group of native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can be featured at the site .	The fish , animals , and birds which may be found at the site are another interest . Fishing interest calls for a check of the species found , quantity and size , the season they are available , and the stocking program of the fish commission . Animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas . The site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its own resident bird life . Clams , crabs , and other marine life may add interest at coastal areas .Each area has its own historical interests with which much can be done . Park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in . The historical sign tells its story , but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the original historical items or places themselves which still have the character of the period covered . Notice should be taken of unusual rock formations , deposits , or shapes of the earth ' s crust in your region . Those which tell a story of the earth ' s formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation sites . An old shipwreck , a high dam , an old covered bridge , a place to find agates or other semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold , etcetera may be of interest . Some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient Indian village sites or hunting areas , caves , artifacts , etcetera .	How well can the site be developed ? ? Look at the physical features of the land to determine how desirable it is for use , what can be done to correct the faults , and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs in comparison to other sites . Many things need to be checked : size and shape -- The size of the area alone can be a determining factor . An area may be too small for the needs of the project . Areas should be large enough to include the attractions , have ample space for the use of facilities needed , and have room around the edges to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments . Acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones .	Shape of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the development . A large picnic area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide . This is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions . However , a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments , or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman ' s trail , or include scenic strips within the park unit .Adjoining areas -- The values of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands , ownership and use of the land , and the utilities available there . For instance , a site adjoining other publicly owned lands , such as a national forest or a public road , may be desirable , whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not . The utilities available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site .Topography -- Topography is very important . Check the elevation of the ground , degree and direction of slopes , drainage , rock outcrops , topsoil types and quality , as well as subsoil . Nearly level areas are required for parking areas , beaches , camp areas , ballfields , etcetera . Determine how much topography limits useful area or what the costs of earth moving or grading might be .Water -- In addition to its recreation interests , water is needed for drinking , sanitation , and irrigation . The quantity and quality of water sources is often a big factor in site selection . The area may provide good springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines . Figure the cost of providing water to the use areas .Plants -- The existing plant growth calls for thorough checking . Look at the trees as to size and interest , the amount of shade they provide , how healthy they are , the problems of maintenance , fire hazards , wind throw , etcetera .	An area may have been partially logged and requires removal of stumps or clean-up . Some shrubs may be of good landscaping value , other areas of brush may need to be cleared . The extent and location of open areas is noted .Exposure -- How much will wind , rain , sun , and temperature affect the use ? ? An area sheltered from strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use . The direction , velocity , and season of these winds should be noted as to just how they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation of the area . Lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable . Sometimes , you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade , morning sun , or whatever may be most desirable for the use intended .Improvements -- Some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings , roads , utilities , cleared land , etcetera which may raise the cost of the site .
	Your invitation to write about Serge Prokofieff to honor his 70th Anniversary for the April issue of Sovietskaya Muzyka is accepted with pleasure , because I admire the music of Prokofieff ; ; and with sober purpose , because the development of Prokofieff personifies , in many ways , the course of music in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics .	The Serge Prokofieff whom we knew in the United States of America was gay , witty , mercurial , full of pranks and bonheur -- and very capable as a professional musician . These qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post-World War 1 , era . Prokofieff ' s outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor in America was , indeed , brilliant .	Prokofieff ' s Classical Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well-trained musician still in his twenties . To the Traditionalists , it was a brilliant satire on modernism ; ; to the Neo-Classicists , it was a challenge to the pre-war world . What was it to Prokofieff ? ? A tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th-Century ideas ; ; a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times ; ; a brilliant piece de resistance ? ? Certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon .	I heard the Classical Symphony for the first time when Koussevitzky conducted it in Paris in 1927 . All musical Paris was there . Some musicians were enthusiastic , some skeptical . I myself was one of the skeptics ( 35 years ago ) . I remember Ernest Bloch in the foyer , shouting in his high-pitched voice : `` it may be a tour de force , mais mon Dieu , can anyone take this music seriously '' ? ?	The answer is , `` Yes '' ! ! Certainly , America took Prokofieff and his Classical Symphony seriously , and with a good deal of pleasure . His life-long friend , Serge Koussevitzky , gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in Boston , New York , and Washington , D . C . , , to which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation . Chicago was also a welcome host : there , in 1921 , Prokofieff conducted the world premiere of the Love For Three Oranges , and played the first performance of his Third Piano Concerto .`` Uncle Sam '' was , indeed , a rich uncle to Prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure : `` The Golden Twenties '' . We attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites ; ; we studied , taught , and performed his piano sonatas , chamber music , gavottes , and marches ; ; we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities . We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth-Century Composers .	Nevertheless , Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties : the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World -- the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated -- the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America -- the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff , Stravinsky , Koussevitzky , Cocteau , Picasso -- the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art -- the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms .	So young Prokofieff was the darling of success : in his motherland ; ; in the spacious hunting grounds of `` Uncle Sam '' ; ; in the exciting salons of his lovely , brilliant Paris -- mistress of gaiety -- excess and abandon -- world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone , color , dance , design , and thought .	Meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing . In this world-wide conscription of men , minds , and machines , Prokofieff was recalled to his native land . The world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty , and the outraged , freedom-loving peoples of the Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist tyranny into cringing submission . After this holocaust , a changing world occupied the minds of men ; ; a world beset with new boundaries , new treaties and governments , new goals and methods , and the age-old fears of aggression and subjugation -- hunger and exposure .	In this changed world , Prokofieff settled to find himself , and to create for large national purpose . Here , this happy , roving son of good fortune proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world . Here , Prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of Socialism -- producing music for the masses .	It is at this point in his life that the mature Prokofieff emerges . One might have expected that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative flair of a composer , especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous .	But no : Prokofieff grew . He accepted the environment of his destiny -- took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his early promise . By 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his people : `` I have striven for clarity and melodious idiom , but at the same time I have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody . This is precisely what makes lucid , straightforward music so difficult to compose -- the clarity must be new , not old '' . How right he was ; ; how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism . And with what resource did Prokofieff back up his Credo of words -- with torrents of powerful music . Compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his neat and witty little Classical Symphony and his big , muscular , passionate , and eloquent Fifth Symphony ; ; or the Love For Three Oranges ( gay as it is ) with the wonderful , imaginative , colorful , and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet , The Stone Flower . This masterpiece has gaiety , too , but it is the gaiety of dancing people : earthy , salty and humorous .	Of course , these works are not comparable , even though the same brain conceived them . The early works were conceived for a sophisticated , international audience ; ; the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life for fellow citizens . However , in all of Prokofieff ' s music , young or mature , we find his profile -- his `` signature '' -- his craftsman ' s attitude . Prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the cause of experimentation per se . In orchestration , he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color . His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable . His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating : witty , clever , adroit , and subtle . His counterpoint is pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick .	Also , it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic modulations , the brilliant orchestrations , the adroitness for evading the heaviness of figured bass , the skill in florid counterpoint were not lost in his mature output , even in the spectacular historical dramas of the stage and cinema , where a large , dramatic canvas of sound was required . That Prokofieff ' s harmonies and forms sometimes seem professionally routine to our ears , may or may not indicate that he was less of an `` original '' than we prefer to believe . Need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability .	Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero , who , by the force of his creative life , helped preserve the main stream of tradition , to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated .	At this date , it seems probable that the name of Serge Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History , as an effective Traditionalist , who was fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation , and used it as it served his purpose ; ; yet was never caught up in it -- never a slave to its academic dialectics . Certainly , it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the Western World -- not his experimentations .	So Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them . Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff would have done better , or even as well , under different circumstances . His fellow-countryman , Igor Stravinsky , certainly did not . Why did Prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity , while Stravinsky ( who leaped into fame like a young giant ) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness ? ? I think the answer is to be found in Prokofieff ' s own words : `` the clarity must be new , not old '' . When Prokofieff forged his new clarity of `` lucid , straightforward music , so difficult to compose '' , he shaped his talents to his purpose .	When Stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures , many salons , many dialectics , many personalities , he tried to refashion himself into a stylist of many styles , determined by many disparate cultures . Prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own people -- by the compass of their national ideas . But Stravinsky was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting . In all his miscalculations , Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming that he could transform other composers ' inspirations -- representing many peoples , time periods and styles -- into his own music by warping the harmony , melody , or form , to verify his own experiments . Because of the authentic homogeneity of his early Nationalistic materials , and his flair for orchestrations -- his brilliant Petruchka , his savage Sacre Du Printemps , his incisive Les Noces -- the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical direction for which his native talents were predisposed .	But time is running out , and many of Stravinsky ' s admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra firma . His various aesthetic postulates remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself : Supra-Expressionism , Neo-Paganism , Neo-Classicism , Neo-Romanticism , Neo-Jazz , Neo-Ecclesiasticism , Neo-Popularism , and most recently , Post-Serialism -- all competing with each other within one composer ! ! What a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations ! ! Meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist ; ; a maladroit reharmonization of our National Anthem ( The Star-Spangled Banner ) ; ; a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto ; ; a circus polka for elephants ; ; his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular American commercial songs ! ! Stravinsky , nearing the age of eighty , is like a lost and frantic bird , flitting from one abandoned nest to another , searching for a home .	How differently Prokofieff ' s life unfolded . Prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without losing his particular force and direction . In the process , his native endowments were stretched , strengthened and disciplined to serve their human purpose .	With a large and circumspect 20th-Century technique , he wove the materials of national heroes and events , national folklore and children ' s fairy tales -- Slavic dances and love songs -- into a solid musical literature which served his people well , and is providing much enjoyment to the World at large .	Of course , it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat , Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him ; ; time and economic security ; ; symphony orchestras , opera and ballet companies ; ; choruses , chamber music ensembles ; ; soloists ; ; recordings ; ; broadcastings ; ; television ; ; large and eager audiences . It must be conceded that his native land provided Prokofieff with many of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive : economic security and cultural opportunities , incisive idioms , social fermentations for a new national ideology -- a sympathetic public and a large body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose .	Thus in Prokofieff the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics produced one of the great composers of the Twentieth Century . That his moods , even in his early years , are those of his people , does him honor , as his music honors those who inspired it . That he mastered every aspect of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary judgments , is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture ; ; and perhaps of even greater significance -- his music is strong 20th-Century evidence of the effectiveness of Evolution , based on a broad Traditionalism for the creative art of music .	April 10 marked a memorable date in New York ' s musical history -- indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern United States . On that date the Musicians Emergency Fund , organized to furnish employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes in the stock market crash , observed its 30th anniversary .
Roy Mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction has a kinship with the English watercolorists of the early nineteenth century , especially the beautifully patterned art of John Sell Cotman . And like this English master , Mason realizes his subjects in large , simplified masses which , though they seem effortless , are in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspired them .	As a boy Roy Mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors , its tang of weather , its change of seasons , its variable moods . His father , a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter , took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions , and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature . Out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew best : hunters in the field , fishermen in the stream , ducks and geese on the wing -- almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape . It is this subject matter that has brought Mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen , but it is his exceptional performance with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors .	Mason had to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting . Like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family business which , though it was allied to art of a kind -- the design and production of engraved seals -- bore no relation to the painting of pictures . But it did teach Roy the basic techniques of commercial art , and later , for twelve years , he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising art studio in Philadelphia . On the death of their father , they returned to their home in Batavia , New York . After more years of concentrated effort , Roy and his brother Max finally established a thriving family business at the old stand .	During all this time Roy continued to paint , first only on weekends , and then , as the family business permitted , for longer periods . Gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether , and for the past thirty years , he has worked independently as a painter , except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions . But even on these , the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off ! !	Except for a rich friendship with the painter , Chauncey Ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had -- and this was limited to a few lessons , though the two artists often went on painting trips together -- Roy developed his art by himself . In the best tradition , he first taught himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and then to paint . He worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor , and his first public recognition and early honors , including his election to the Academy , were for his essays in the heavier medium . Gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique .	It has been my privilege to paint with Roy Mason on numerous occasions , mostly in the vicinity of Batavia . More often than not I have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where I could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed , not imitative , painting . What I have observed time and time again is a process of integration , integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form ; ; color patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition ; ; and that over-all , amazing control of large washes which is the Mason stylemark . Finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the job is done . Inspiring -- yes ; ; instructive -- maybe ; ; duplicable -- no ! !	But for the technical fact , we have the artist ' s own testimony : 	`` Of late years , I find that I like best to work out-of-doors . First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale ( approximately Af inches ) in which I pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values -- the lightest light , the middle tone , and the darkest dark -- by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns . If a human figure or wild life are to be part of the projected final picture , I try to place them in the initial sketch . For me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage , though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose .	`` I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him ; ; as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him . Just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting , unless the position serves the design of the whole composition . If the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design , often only slightly , finer pictures would result . Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees , logs , and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which I call clicking .	`` Speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution , he would do well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition .	`` If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition , I mean to project equal concern for color . Often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat . When this occurs , I make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor -- if I have been working on a full sheet in the field .	`` When working from one of my sketches I square it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal . When this linear draft is completed , I dust it down to a faint image . From this point , I paint in as direct a manner as possible , by flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as I can manage . However , first I thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines I have described . Then I plan my attack : the parts I will finish first , the range of values , the accenting of minor details -- all in all , mechanics of producing the finished job with a maximum of crispness . The longer I work , the more I am sure that for me , at least , a workmanlike method is important . Trial and error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles in the final painting .	`` As for materials , I use the best available . I work on a watercolor easel in the field , and frequently resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue strain . In my studio I work at a tilt-top table , but leave the paper unfixed so that I can move it freely to control the washes . I have used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers , but prefer an English make , rough surface , in 400-pound weight . After selecting a sheet and inspecting it for flaws ( even the best sometimes has foreign ' nubbins ' on its surface ) , I sponge it thoroughly on both sides with clean , cold water . Then I dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat as a board .	`` In addition to the usual tools , I make constant use of cleansing tissue , not only to wipe my brushes , but to mop up certain areas , to soften edges , and to open up lights in dark washes . The great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the watercolorist . I also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large washes in the studio .	`` My brushes are different from those used by most watercolorists , for I combine the sable and the bristle . The red sables are 8 ; ; two riggers , 6 and 10 ; ; and a very large , flat wash brush . The bristles are a Fitch 2 and a one-half inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge .	`` My usual palette consists of top-quality colors : alizarin crimson , orange , raw sienna , raw umber , burnt sienna , sepia , cerulean blue , cobalt blue , French ultramarine blue , Winsor green , Hooker ' s green 2 , cadmium yellow pale , yellow ochre , Payne ' s gray , charcoal gray , Davy ' s gray , and ivory black '' .	In analyzing the watercolors of Roy Mason , the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness , yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here . True , a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory . Unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist ' s pictures are full of atmosphere and climate .	Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes : a foreground in sharp focus -- either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights ; ; a middle distance often containing the major motif ; ; and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky . In following this general principle , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created .	When painting , Mason ' s physical eyes are half-closed , while his mind ' s eye is wide open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey . He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject ; ; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia . It is for this reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment . His pictures generalize , though they are inspired by a particular locale ; ; they universalize in terms of weather , skies , earth , and people . By dealing with common landscape in an uncommon way , Roy Mason has found a particular niche in American landscape art . Living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor , a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the Creator of it all .	The artist was born in Gilbert Mills , New York , in 1886 , and until two years ago when he and his wife moved to California , he lived in western New York , in Batavia . When I looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be March 15th , I realized that Roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist : the water sign of Pisces ( February 18 thru March 20 ) . And how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes , and how appropriate that he should appear in American Artist again , in his natal month of March ! !	Over the years , beginning in 1929 , Mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold medals ; ; two Ranger Fund purchase awards ; ; the Joseph Pennell Memorial Medal ; ; two American Watercolor Society prizes ; ; the Blair Purchase Prize for watercolor , Art Institute of Chicago ; ; and others in Buffalo , New York , Chautauqua , New Haven , Rochester , Rockport , and most recently , the $300 prize for a watercolor at the Laguna Beach Art Association , 	He was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate in the oil class in 1931 ( after receiving his first Ranger Fund Purchase Prize at the Academy in 1930 ) , and elevated to Academicianship in 1940 . Other memberships include the American Watercolor Society , Philadelphia Water Color Club , Allied Artists of America , Audubon Artists , Baltimore Watercolor Society .
	The Russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the American gymnasts in the 1960 Olympics for one reason -- they were better . They were better trained , better looking , better built , better disciplined and something else -- they were better dancers . Our athletes are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance . The Russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics .	But why gymnastics at all ? ? And is the sport really important ? ? After all , we did pretty well in some other areas of the Olympics competition . But if it is important , what can we do to improve ourselves ? ? It is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics .	Taking first things first , let ' s understand the sport called gymnastics . It is made up of tumbling , which might be said to start with a somersault , run through such stunts as headstands , handstands , cartwheels , backbends , and culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists and apparatus work . The apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight in American gyms , but about 1930 it was dropped in favor of games . The parallel bars , horse , buck , springboard , horizontal bar , rings , and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball , volleyball , basketball and football .	But the Russians use gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one , endurance . The gymnast must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , discipline , persistence and the desire for perfection . In short , gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great deal of character as well . The addition of endurance training later , when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury , provides that final quality that makes the top athlete , soldier or citizen .	Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life .( An enterprising teacher or parent could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days . Most Europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries .) In most sports , as in most walks of life , the angels are on the side of those who begin young , and the Russian competitor of 16 has at least thirteen years of training behind him . The American is very lucky if he has three .	If a nation wished to get a head start in physical fitness over all other nations , it would start its kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large number of the problems that plague American schools . First of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension , since action relieves both . Oddly enough , it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty . Certainly there would be less anxiety , fewer accidents ( it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries ) , and higher scholastic averages , since alert children work better . Russia knows this , and that is why there were over 800 , 000 competing for places as candidates for the Olympic gymnastic team . Eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself . We could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people .	And what has dancing to do with all this ? ? A great deal . Russia ' s young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous training on apparatus . Well-stretched , trained in posture and coordinated movement , and wedded to rhythm , they presented the audiences in Rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any Olympic contest . American audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons . They saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing with incredible grace . They were further stripped of old wive ' s tales by seeing the slender , lovely Russian girls performing feats requiring tremendous strength and with not one bulging muscle .	President Kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation . If we wait until children are in junior high or high school , we will never manage it . To be fit , one has to start early with young children , and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher of dance . If the dance teachers of America make it their business to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come some day if our schools are really responsible , we will be that much ahead . School teachers , all too unprepared for the job they must do , will need demonstrators . There should be youngsters who know how to do a headstand , and also how to help other children learn it . They should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the sports we will demand be taught .	Dance teachers can respond to President Kennedy ' s request not only through their regular dance work , but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes for strength and flexibility .	Very little in today ' s living provides the strength we need and nothing provides the flexibility . Dancers do have flexibility . They often fail , however , to develop real abdominal , back , chest , shoulder and arm strength . Ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results , considering the amount of physical training they have had , will be very disappointing . Even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas . This isn ' t surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11-year-old boys in America cannot chin themselves once , and that English school girls outdo them in almost every test ( even dashes and endurance ) . The only area in which American boys hold their own is the baseball throw .The chinning bar For arm and shoulder strength a chinning bar is recommended . It should be installed over a door that is in full view of everyone , and a chair should be placed under it , a little to one side . Those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin-up each time they pass under it . Those who are too weak , should climb on the chair and , starting at the top of the chin , let themselves slowly down . When they can take ten seconds to accomplish the descent , they will have the strength to chin-up . Parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home .The horse kick Arm , shoulder , chest , upper and lower back strength will be aided with the Horse kick . Start on hands and feet . Keeping the hands in the starting position , run in place to a quick rhythm . After this has become easy , use slower and slower rhythms , kicking higher and higher . Follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on all fours , kicking as high as possible .Push-ups Push-ups are essential , but few have the strength for them at first . Start on the knees in a large circle . Fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body down to rest on the floor . Push back up and repeat . Do this exercise six times each class period . As strength improves start in a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward . Start by falling forward to a point close to the feet , and , as strength improves , fall farther and farther out . Try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes from the hands . The push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top of the push-up with legs spread wide . Let the body down slowly , taking at least five seconds for the letting down . Five of these done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up .Handstands Handstands come after arms , chest and shoulders have developed at least a minimum of strength . Of course those who have developed more will find them easier . Start with the class standing in a circle , with weight on the right foot and the left extended a little way into the circle . At first each child should do a kick-up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone , and those who need help . Drop both hands to the floor and at the same time kick the right foot up in back . The left will follow at once . The right will land first , followed by the left . Return to the standing position . Care should be taken to see that the hands are placed on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot is brought as close to the hands as possible . This will prevent flat falls and toe injuries . Bare feet are better for such work than any form of slipper . Eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher can catch the leading leg . The child should then bring both legs together overhead , point the toes and tighten the seat muscles . Be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the hands and that only one foot lands at a time .Backbends The backbend is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics , and , as with all acrobatics , the sooner begun the better the results . Have the class lie supine with knees apart and bent . Place flat palms on either side of the head a few inches away from the ears , fingers pointing toward the shoulders . Arch the back upwards to make a bridge . Be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor rather than toward the ceiling . As flexibility improves , the feet will move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher . Later this can be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover .Back circle To further increase back flexibility , work on the back circle . Have the class lie prone . Place the hands in front of the chest . Keep the legs straight and the toes pointed . Straighten the arms slowly , this arches the back . At the peak of the arch , tip the head back and bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head . Improvement can be measured by the lessening distance between toes and head .Somersaults The last essential to the beginner ' s gymnastic program is the somersault , or forward roll . This used to be part of every child ' s bag of tricks , but few children can do it today ; ; some are actually incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting or standing upright . For most small children , learning a forward roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can . After it has been seen , have the child start on a mat on hands and knees ( a thin , inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require falling ) . He places the hands on either side of the head , keeping the chin down on the chest . He then pushes his seat into the air and the teacher guides it over . One or two practice runs should be sufficient for solo . If , however , the child is weak , overweight , or afraid , more help will be needed . When the child raises his seat into the air , the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis ; ; then no matter what happens , the child ' s performance will be controlled . By lifting the seat upwards a little , the weight is taken off the neck and the back is kept rounded .	These are beginnings , but correctly learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed by a strong , flexible body ( we are not talking of eccentric extremes ) . Even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal , the good tumbler will be a better dancer , a better athlete , and a human being with a greater margin of safety in any activity .	It is very important for parents to understand that early training is imperative . And dancing school , so helpful in artistic and psychological development , also contributes to this essential early training -- and can contribute even more .
	Every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics . We have noted how some electronic techniques , developed for the defense effort , have evenutally been used in commerce and industry . The host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality .	When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering . The author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that , in this area alone , the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities . The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery . We use the term `` bio-medicine '' because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research .	Electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine , the electrocardiograph , and the diathermy machine . Recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage of bruises , contusions , and simple bursitis .	Commonly used electronic devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit TV and audio systems for internal paging and instruction , along with radiation counters , timers , and similar devices .	In this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this is where tomorrow ' s commonplace equipment originates . From the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research .Ultraviolet microscopy Many cells , bacteria , and other microorganisms are transparent to visible light and must be stained for microscopic investigation . This stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside . A completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-TV system to view the results .	Fig . 1 is a simplified block diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the Medical Electronics Center of Rockefeller Institute . By combining the talents of a medical man , Dr . Aterman , a biophysicist , Mr . Berkely , and an electronics expert , Dr . Zworykin , this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding life processes .	Three different wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources . These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror ; ; the specimen is magnified by the microscope . Instead of the observer ' s eye the image orthicon in the TV camera does the `` looking '' . The microscope and orthicon are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum , which means that all lenses must be quartz .	The video signal is amplified and then switched , in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength , corresponding to red , green , or blue , is seen .( Note : Because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source to another , the lights are switched by a commutator-like assembly rotated by a synchronous motor . This assembly also supplies a 20-cps switching gate for the electronics circuitry .) This is the same system as was used in the field-sequential color-TV system which preceded the present simultaneous system . Three separate amplifiers then drive a 21-inch tricolor tube . The result is a color picture of the specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelengths .	Many of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent to visible light , absorb or reflect the much shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum . Different parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color . Where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows or nothing at all , ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation into a color TV picture reveal a wealth of detail .	At the present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it .Breathing -- electronically analyzed The medical title of `` Lobar Ventilation In Man '' by Drs . C . J . Martin and A . C . Young , covers a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process . At the University of Washington Medical School , the electronics group has developed the `` Respiratory Gas Analyzer '' shown in Fig . 3 . This unit , affectionately dubbed `` The Monster '' , can be wheeled to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient ' s breathing .	In the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper and lower lobes of one lung , the total volume of inhalation per breath , the flow of air from both lobes , and the pressure of the two lobes with respect to each other . Usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece while walking a treadmill , standing still , or in some other medically significant position . From the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail .Heart-measuring techniques The original electrocardiograph primarily indicates irregularities in the heartbeat , but today ' s techniques allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta , dimensioning of the heart and its chambers , and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat . For many of these measurements the chest must be opened , but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed .	A group of researchers at the University of Washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques . One simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube , filled with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched . A balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed .	Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy . The travel time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second ; ; thus it takes about 16 Msec . to traverse 25 mm . of tissue . A sonar or radar-type of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for body-tissue evaluation . In addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique . The Doppler effect , using ultrasonic signals , can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel .	A still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself . It uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor inserted into the bloodstream . The latter measures the heat carried away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow . It is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer , mounted at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart ' s left ventricle , to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself . This pressure measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is made . A simplified version of the instrumentation for this procedure is shown in Fig . 2 . Outputs of the two systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge , followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder . From this doctors can read heart rate , change in diameter , pressure , and effective heart power .Radio-transmitter pills Several years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receivers . This original capsule contained a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm . in diameter . Battery life limited the use of this `` pill '' to about 8 to 30 hours maximum .	A refinement of this technique has been described by Drs . Zworykin and Farrar and Mr . Berkely of the Medical Electronics Center of the Rockefeller Institute . In this novel arrangement the `` pill '' is much smaller and contains only a resonant circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure-sensing transducer . As shown in Fig . 4 , an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400-kc . bursts . The energy received by the `` pill '' causes the resonant circuit to `` ring '' on after the burst and this `` ringing '' takes place at the resonant frequency of the `` pill '' . These frequencies are amplified and detected by the FM receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and , after the `` pill '' has been calibrated , precise internal pressure indications can be obtained .	One of the advantages of this method is that the `` pill '' can remain in the patient for several days , permitting observation under natural conditions . Applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are planned for future experiments .Sonar in medical research One of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine detection is in the exploration of the human body . Our readers are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects . Various methods of pulsing , scanning , and displaying these sound waves are used to detect submarines , map ocean floors , and even communicate under water . In medicine the frequencies are much higher , transducers and the sonar beams themselves are much smaller , and different scanning techniques may be used , but the principles involved are the same as in sonar .	Because the body contains so much liquid , transmission of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels . Bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals . Based on this phenomenon , a number of investigators have used this method to `` look through '' human organs . A good example of the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers presented by Dr . G . Baum who has explored the human eye . He can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness due to glaucoma . The method used to scan the eye ultrasonically is illustrated in Fig . 6 . The transducer is coupled to the body through a water bath , not shown . For display , Dr . Baum uses a portion of an Af , an airborne radar indicator , and then photographs the screen to obtain a permanent record .	A typical `` sonogram '' of a human eye , together with a description of the anatomical parts , is shown in Fig . 5 . The frequency used for these experiments is 15 mc . and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter . The transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan , just like a radar antenna , while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 90-degree arc in front of the eye to `` look into '' all corners . The total picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector scans over the entire 90-degree rotation period .	Drs . Howry and Holmes at the University of Colorado Medical School have applied the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results . By submerging the patient in a tub and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on , they have been able to get cross-section views of the neck , as shown in Fig . 7 , as well as many other hitherto impossible insights . As mentioned before , bone reflects the sound energy and in Fig . 7 the portion of the spine shows as the black area in the center . Arteries and veins are apparent by their black , blood-filled centers and the surrounding white walls .	A cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown in Fig . 8 with the various parts labeled .
	Oersted ' s boyhood represented a minimal chance of either attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a span of life . He was born in the small Danish town of Rudkoebing on the island of Langeland in the south-central part of Denmark on August 14 , 1777 . His father Soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family , let alone educate them in a town without even a school . The two older boys , Hans and Anders , his junior by a year , therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German ; ; his wife taught the two boys to read and write Danish . Other brothers later joined them for instruction with Oldenburg , the wigmaker , and also arithmetic was added to Bible reading , German , and Danish in the informal curriculum . Oldenburg ' s contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town ' s learned , such as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching . From the town surveyor , Hans learned drawing and mathematics and , from a university student , some academic subjects . The mayor of the town taught them English and French . Whatever Hans or Anders learned separately they passed on to each other ; ; they read every book that they could borrow in the village . At 12 , Hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in the apothecary shop , which helped stimulate his interest in medicine and science . His earlier love for literature and history remained with him for his entire life .	In 1793 the brothers decided to enter the University of Copenhagen ( founded in 1479 ) and the following spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the autumn session . While Hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine , physics , and astronomy , his brother studied law . The brothers continued to help each other during their studies , sharing a joint purse , lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of their aunt . They supplemented their income by small government assistance , by tutoring and economizing wherever they could . So impressive were those serious years of study at the university that Hans later wrote , `` to be perfectly free , the young man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and imagination ; ; there is a struggle there , in which , if he falls , it is easy for him to rise again , there is freedom of utterance there , which draws after it no irreparable consequences on society . I lived in this onward-driving contest where each day overcame a new difficulty , gained a new truth , or banished a previous error '' . He openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing about science . In this third year at the university , Hans , in 1797 , was awarded the first important token of recognition , a gold medal for his essay on `` Limits Of Poetry And Prose '' . He completed his training in pharmacy also , taking his degree with high honors in 1797 , and in 1799 was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine . He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis which later was accepted in chemical practices .Ferment of scientific activity Hans ' student days were at a time when Europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America and in France , Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the Continent .	The new century opened with Oersted beginning his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in Copenhagen and as lecturer at the university . He was stirred by the announcement of Volta ' s discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis . The following year he devoted to the customary `` Wanderjahr '' , traveling in Germany , France , and the Netherlands , meeting the philosophers Schelling , Fichte , and Tieck . He also met Count Rumford ( born Benjamin Thompson in Woburn , Mass . ) who was then serving the Elector of Bavaria , and the physicist Ritter ; ; these were Oersted ' s main contacts in science .	From Gottingen ( 1801 ) where he stayed for 10 days , he wrote , `` The first question asked everywhere is about galvanism . As everybody is curious to see the battery of glass tubes I have invented , I have had quite a small one made here of four glass tubes ( in Copenhagen I used 30 ) and intend to carry it with me '' . Oersted joined Ritter at Jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks , continuing their correspondence after he left . With Ritter he was exposed to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host ' s fertile but disorganized mind . Oersted remodeled Ritter ' s notes into an essay in French which was submitted to the Institut De France for its annual prize of 3 , 000 francs . The sound discoveries of this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him . In May , 1803 , Ritter , in another flight of fancy , wrote to Oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy . He related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided with the years of important electrical discoveries . Thus , 1745 corresponded to the invention of the `` Leiden '' jar by Kleist , 1764 that of the electrophorus by Wilcke , 1782 produced the condenser of Volta , and 1801 the voltaic pile . Ritter proceeded , `` You now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820 , you will have to reckon . This we might well witness '' . Ritter died in 1810 and Oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of it .	In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied for the university ' s chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a physicist . However , he continued experimenting and lecturing , publishing the results of his experiments in German and Danish periodicals . In 1806 his ambition was realized and he became professor of physics at the Copenhagen University , though not realizing full professorship ( ordinarius ) until 1817 .	During Oersted ' s attendance at the university , it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences . He was , however , fortunate in his contact with Prof . J . G . L . Manthey ( 1769-1842 ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in addition to his academic chair , was also proprietor of the `` Lion Pharmacy '' in Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him . Manthey maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at Oersted ' s disposal during and after his graduation . In 1800 , Manthey went abroad and Oersted was appointed manager of the Lion Pharmacy . In February 1801 , Oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and lead . In the following year , 1803 , Oersted , simultaneously with Davy , discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic battery more than did salts . Eager as he was to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to `` galvanizing '' .	He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood . The university was the only one in Denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level . His broad interest in literary , political , and philosophical movements opened many doors to him . His friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong .	The years 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France again , but on this visit to Berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his first journey . In Berlin he published his views of the chemical laws of nature in German and this was issued in French translation ( Paris , 1813 ) under the title Recherches Sur l ' identite Des Forces chimiques et electriques , a work held in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemists . His interest in finding a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated . Chapter 8 , is entitled `` On Magnetism '' and in it are included such remarks as , `` One has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces with the electrical forces . The great resemblance between electrical and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their laws necessarily would bring about this comparison . It is true , that nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication ; ; but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference . The form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form . There , forces are more latent than in electricity , and less than in magnetism . But in such an important question , we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and magnetism were only a difficulty , and not a thing which is contrary to it . One could also add to these analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat , which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature , just as electrical bodies do . It is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature , as proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb . By that , one feels that magnetic forces are as general as electrical forces . An attempt should be made to see if electricity , in its most latent stage , has any action on the magnet as such '' . His plan and intent were clearly charted .	Oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and political discussions . In one debate he supported the freedom of judgment as opposed to dogma , in another he held that the practice of science was in fact an act of religious worship . He continued as a popular lecturer . He devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric current .	In 1819 under royal command he undertook a very successful geological expedition to Bornholm , one of the Danish islands , being one of three scientists in the expedition . It was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition , Lauritz Esmarch , that Oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric current was made to flow . Together they also developed a new form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of copper , thereby producing stronger currents . Esmarch was among those who witnessed Oersted ' s first demonstration of his discovery .Discovery of electromagnetism the association between electric ( both electrostatic and voltaic ) forces and magnetic forces had been recognized by investigators for many decades . Electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles . In the late 1700 ' s Beccaria and Van Marum , among others , had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic charge through it . Beccaria had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a Leyden jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic . The resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise . The experiments of Romagnosi and others have already been noted but no one had determined the cause-and-effect relationship between these two primary forces . Oersted ' s own earlier experiments were unimpressive , possibly because he had , like other experimenters , laid the conducting wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it .	The sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the university related that the first direct event that led to the publication of Oersted ' s discovery occurred during a private lecture made before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820 . At this lecture Oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel to a magnetic needle .
Knowing specifically what the many feed additives can do and how and when to feed them can make a highly competitive business more profitable for beef , dairy , and sheep men .	The target chart quickly and briefly tells you which additives do what . All the additives listed here are sanctioned for use by the Food and Drug Administration of the federal government . All comments concerning effectiveness and use of drugs have been carefully reviewed by a veterinary medical officer with Aj .	This article assumes that the rations you are feeding your beef , dairy cattle , and sheep are adequately balanced with protein , vitamins , and minerals .	The drug ' s chemical name is listed , since most states require feed processors to use this name instead of the trade name on the feed tag . In some instances , the trade name is shown in parentheses following the chemical name . This indicates that this drug is being marketed under one trade name only or state regulatory organizations have approved its use on the feed tag .Here ' s your feed additive guide for ruminants : drug ' s chemical name : Oxytetracycline hydrochloride ( Terramycin ) what it does : Increases rate of gain and improves feed efficiency , aids in the prevention or treatment ( depending on level fed ) of the early stages of shipping fever , prevents or treats bacterial diarrhea , and aids in reducing incidence of bloat and liver abscesses .

There are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle : ( 1 ) Fence-line bunks -- cattle eat from one side while feed is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons ; ;( 2 ) Mechanized bunks -- they sit within the feed lot , are filled by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface ; ;( 3 ) Special bunks -- as discussed here , they permit cattle to eat from all sides . Feed is put in with an elevator .	Several materials or combinations of materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk . The selection of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation , cost of materials available locally , and your own preference . No one material is best for all situations . Selecting bunks by economic comparison is usually an individual problem .Fence-line feeding .Animals eat only from one side , so the fence-line bunk must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk . These bunks also serve as a fence , so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence . Because of their location , on the edge of the feed lot , fence-line bunks are not in the way of mechanical manure removal . Filling these bunks by the same self-unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the wagons over more time and operations .	All-weather roads must be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all year . This will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall .
Marketing in the new decade will be no picnic -- for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experienced in the last 20-25 yrs . .	Why ? ? Companies of all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies -- in modern equipment and new processes , enlarged R & D facilities , faster new product development . Many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling , distribution , and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge .	Given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yrs . ? ? Based on our experience with clients , , we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups -- the market place itself , marketing methods , and marketing management .1 . Problems in the market greater price-consciousness .There has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent years ; ; there is every indication it will continue . Frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers , distributors , and dealers . Despite generally good levels of income , we see greater price pressures than ever before -- traveling back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer .	Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target : 	Has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning ? ? Have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse ? ? Have you actually checked out ( not just mentally tested ) different selling approaches designed to counter the price competition problem ? ? Increased customer sophistication .Average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding product and advertising claims , partly because of widespread criticism of such assertions . This problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds of businesses . Have you examined this problem of increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company ? ? Greater demand for services .Need for service is here to stay -- and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the sixties . There are two reasons for this . First , most products tend to become more complex . Second , in a competitive market , the customer feels his weight and throws it around .	Providing good customer service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning job as the original selling of the product . Too often it is thought of at the last moment of new product introduction .	Good service starts with product design and planning : Many products seem to be designed for a production economy , not for a service one . Proper follow-through requires training your own sales organization , and your distributor organizations , not only in the techniques but also in good customer relations .	Have you assessed the importance of service and given it proper attention ? ? Wider discretionary choices for customers .In spending his money today , the consumer is pulled in many directions . To the manufacturer of the more convenient-type product -- the purchase of which can be switched , delayed , or put off entirely -- the implications are important . Your competition is now proportionately greater -- you are competing not only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products .	Many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer ' s dollar being spent on their particular products . Has your company thought through its strategy in this whole `` discretionary buying '' area ? ? Geographic shift of customers .The trends have been in evidence for many years -- population shifts to the Southwest and Far West , and from city to suburbs . These shifts will continue in the next 10 yrs . . Have you considered the implications of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation , strength of distributor organizations , and even plant location ? ? Market concentration and distribution in fewer accounts .We have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions in the food industry -- at both the manufacturing and retail ends . Instead of relatively small sales to many accounts , there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts .	The change may require different products , pricing , packaging , warehousing , salesmanship , advertising and executive attention -- practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted . Have you examined these trends , forecast the effects , and planned your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstances ? ?2 . Problems in marketing methods more private label competition .In the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under way during the first decade . As mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer ' s as well as the distributor ' s profits -- which is , in effect , what the sale of private brands tends to do .	Average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business , delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded . Moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain stores have insisted on high quality -- and the customer seems to have caught on .	If you are up against private brand competition , have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening your market position ? ? If private brand competition hasn ' t been felt in your product field as yet , have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear ? ? Less personal salesmanship .Display merchandising , backed by pre-selling through advertising and promotion , will continue to make strides in the sixties . It has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program .	How can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are still important ? ? If you have a higher-quality product , how can you make it stand out -- justify its premium price -- without the spoken word ? ? Salesmanship is still necessary , but it ' s a different brand of salesmanship .	Have you carefully examined the selling techniques which best suit your products ? ? Have you studied the caliber and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements for effective marketing ? ? Are you experimenting with different selling slants in developing new customers ? ? Higher costs of distribution generally .Some distribution costs are kept up by competitive pressure , some by the fact that the customers have come to expect certain niceties and flourishes . No manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing out the costs involved .	The use of bulk handling is continuously growing . Computers are being used to keep branch inventories at more workable levels .`` Selective selling '' -- concentrating sales on the larger accounts -- has been used effectively by some manufacturers .	There may be possible economies at any one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain . Do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully -- and with some imagination ? ? In your sales force , will a smaller number of higher-priced , high-quality salesmen serve you best , or can you make out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen ? ?	Will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share ? ? In one company covering the country with a high-quality sales force of 10 men , the president personally phones each major account every 6 mos . . As a result , distribution costs were cut , customer relations improved .	Distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties -- and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job . Higher costs of advertising and promotion .From the manufacturer ' s point of view , the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties . It is accentuated by the need for pre-selling goods , and private label competition .	How much fundamental thinking and research has your company done on its advertising program ? ? Are you following competition willy-nilly -- trying to match dollar for dollar -- or are you experimenting with new means for reaching and influencing consumers ? ? Have you evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion in your total marketing program -- from the standpoint of effort , money , and effectiveness ? ? Increasing tempo of new product development .Practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products on the horizon . Will you be out in the market place with some of these sales-building new products ? ?	If competition beats you to it , this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store . On the other hand , the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing the new one is usually mighty expensive . As markets become larger and marketing more complex , the costs of an error become progressively larger .	Is your R & D or product development program tuned in to the commercial realities of the market ? ? Are there regular communications from the field , or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with R & D people ? ? Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing , but it ' s useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register .	Are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization ; ; who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume , production , and distribution costs ; ; and translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which management can act on with some assurance ? ? We have seen good new products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts and plans -- and management couldn ' t make up its mind .3 . Problems in marketing management shortage of skilled salesmen .There is a shortage of salesmen today . In the future , quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy , and the qualitative need will be greater still .	While many companies have done fine work in developing sales personnel , much of it has been product rather than sales training . Nor has the training been enough in relation to the need . Most marketing people agree it is going to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future requirements .	Have you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future ( both quantitatively and qualitatively ) ? ? Has your company developed selection and training processes that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen you will need in the next 10 yrs . ? ? Shortage of sales management talent .With the growing complexity of markets and intensity of competition , sales management , whether at the district , region or headquarters level , is a tough job today -- and it will be tougher in the future . Men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications called for by this type of management work . The growth of business has outdistanced the available supply , and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties .	Does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel for the longer term ? ? Does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people ? ? Complexity of complete marketing planning .Every single problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning .`` Hip-pocket '' tactics are going to be harder to apply . Many food and beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis . They have to be . With greater investments in plant facilities , with automation growing , you can ' t switch around , either in volume or in product design , as much as was formerly possible -- or at least not as economically .	Are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently in your company ? ? We find too many sales and marketing executives so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning .	Are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the marketing team ? ? Do you have a long-term ( 5- or 10-yr . ) marketing program ? ?	The key to effective marketing is wrapped up in defining your company ' s marketing problems realistically . Solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems , whether they be in the market , in marketing methods or in marketing management .	If companies will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke , then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective marketing in next decade .
The controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference of opinion . The architects do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building .	Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables , workshops or panel discussions -- whatever they are called -- on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled down crux of the matter is education .	It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more . The element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure . This would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior designer ' s training .	We may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior design student as not having serious bearing on the subject . The real question that follows is -- how are those four years used and what is their value as training ? ?	The American Institute of Interior Designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course . An examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design , for the most part schools accredited by membership in the National Association of Schools of Art , and a further `` on the spot '' inspection of a number of schools , show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations . One or two of the schools have a five year curriculum , but the usual pattern of American education has limited most of them to the four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions .	The suggested course of the A . I . D . was based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to curricular necessities . Obviously , the four year provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated .	Without comparing the relative merits of the two courses -- architecture versus interior design -- let us examine the educational needs of the interior designer .	To begin with , what is an interior designer ? ?`` The Dictionary Of Occupational Titles '' published by the U . S . Department of Labor describes him as follows : `` Designs , plans and furnishes interiors of houses , commercial and institutional structures , hotels , clubs , ships , theaters , as well as set decorations for motion picture arts and television . Makes drawings and plans of rooms showing placement of furniture , floor coverings , wall decorations , and determines color schemes .	Furnishes complete cost estimates for clients approval . Makes necessary purchases , places contracts , supervises construction , installation , finishing and placement of furniture , fixtures and other correlated furnishings , and follows through to completion of project '' .	In addition to this the U . S . Civil Service Bureau , when examining applicants for government positions as interior designers , expects that `` when various needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them . He must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture of any craft materials needed in the furnishings '' .	This seems like a large order . The interior designer , then , must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance . Yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice it . And further he must understand his obligation to the client to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society .	Few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording of their curriculum . It is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise .	The old established independent art schools try their best to fulfill their obligations . Yet even here many a problem is presented ; ; as in a recent design competition with a floor plan and the simple command -- `` design a luxury apartment '' ; ; no description of the client or his cultural level , no assertion of geographical area or local social necessities -- simply `` a luxury apartment '' . Working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior design .	It is possible , of course , to work on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so that the student may get `` the feel '' of real interior design demands . Unfortunately , the purely synthetic problem is the rule .	It is like medical schools in India where , in that fairy-land of religious inhibition , the dissection of dead bodies is frowned upon . Instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs of plants . Thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience .	In the earlier years of training certain phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its use . But to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable .	Consultation with architects , clients , real estate men , fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work . Fortunately , although only a few years ago they held the student at arms length , today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student , not only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of tomorrow -- that the student already is `` in the trade '' .	Even the `` history of furniture '' can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern slides . Here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experienced .	The professional organizations such as American Institute of Interior Designers , National Society of Interior Designers , Home Fashions League and various trade associations , can and do aid greatly in this work . Certainly every educator involved in interior design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organizations .	Not only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations , but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject .	Participation for the educator in this case , however , would have to be raised to full and complete membership . The largest of these organizations at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and , indeed , refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog .	This anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students . The professor in turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice .	This seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced , the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands .	In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice to the schools . That is in the continuance of the `` grandfather clauses '' in their membership requirements .	When these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth . Long hard years of `` on the job '' training had brought them to their competence .	The necessity of that day has long disappeared . There is plenty of opportunity for proper education today . It is discouraging for students to realize that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they are supposed to stand .	The reason and the day of `` grandfather clauses '' has long since passed . No one can deny that these `` back door '' admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies .	Beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves . It will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education , a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his students . The local decorator who rushes in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these qualifications .	Nor will the hack , the Jack-of-all-trades , still found in some of the smaller art schools , suffice .	Only a few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior design . At the end of its letter was the information that applicants for this position `` must also be prepared to teach costume design and advertising art '' . This kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer .	We must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior design who have had education , experience in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments of teaching -- minimal income and minimal status among their confreres .	Considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture , furniture design , textiles and color is also desirable .	In all `` degree '' courses in interior design a number of `` academic '' or `` general studies '' courses are included . It is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in English , history , psychology and so on be as well informed in matters of art , especially interior design , as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects . The proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed . The matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken into account .	One technical question of school organization comes to mind here . For proper accreditation of schools , teachers in any course must have a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate . Since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed . Indeed , it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable schools of art have granted degrees at all . The question , however , cannot be ignored for long . The basic problem involved is that a college setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree . Most professors in the course must , naturally , again have a higher degree than the course offers . One solution is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute . It is a sort of academic ring-around-a-rosy and you solve it .	This brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general . Only the independent art schools , that is , those not connected with any university or college , receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organizations . It has been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of their fine arts department . This , plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics department , yet , nevertheless , claiming that they teach interior design , has contributed to the low repute of many university courses in interior design . In spite of this , many universities offer adequate and even distinguished courses in the subject .	There will be no mitigation of these offences until all art schools , whether independent or attached to universities have separate accreditation -- as do medical schools -- by an art accreditation group such as the `` National Association of Schools of Art '' .	Independent art schools granting degrees must , naturally , follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional group .
Wildlife habitat resources In 1960 one-quarter of the 92 . 5 million recreation visits to the National Forests and Grasslands were for the primary purpose of hunting and fishing . Hunter and fisherman visits since 1949 have increased 8 times faster than the nationwide sale of hunting and fishing licenses . This use is expected to increase to about 50 million visits by 1972 . The long-range objective of habitat management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and game populations to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment .	The wildlife habitat management proposals for the 10-year period are : 1 .Revise and complete wildlife habitat management and improvement plans for all administrative units , assuring proper coordination between wildlife habitat management and other resources . 2 .Inventory and evaluate wildlife habitat resources in cooperation with other Federal agencies and with the States in which National Forests and Grasslands are located , as a basis for orderly development of wildlife habitat improvement and coordination programs , including ( A ) big-game , gamebird , and small-game habitat surveys and investigations on the 186 million acres of National Forests and Grasslands , ( B ) fishery habitat surveys and investigations on the 81 , 000 miles of National Forest fishing streams and nearly 3 million acres of lakes and impoundments , and ( C ) participation in planning , inspection , and control phases of all habitat improvement , land and water use projects conducted on National Forest lands by States , other Federal agencies , and private groups to assure that projects will benefit wildlife and be in harmony with other resource values . 3 .Improve food and cover on 1 . 5 million acres of key wildlife areas . 4 .Develop wildlife openings , food patches , and game ways in dense vegetation by clearing or controlled burning on 400 , 000 acres . 5 .Improve 7 , 000 miles of fishing streams and 56 , 000 acres of lakes by stabilizing banks , planting streamside cover , and constructing channel improvements .Protection The total adverse impact of disease , insects , fire , weather , destructive animals , and other forces on the uses and values of forest resources is not generally recognized . They kill and destroy , retard or prevent reproduction and growth , impair and damage values , and disrupt uses .	The loss in growth of sawtimber because of damage by destructive agencies in the United States in 1952 was estimated to be about 44 billion board feet . If it were not for the effect of destructive agencies , sawtimber growth would have been nearly twice as great as the 47 billion board feet in 1952 . About 45 percent of the loss in growth was attributable to disease , 20 percent to insects , 17 percent to fire , and 18 percent to weather , animals , and various other causes .	These destructive forces also have a seriously adverse effect upon the watersheds and their life-supporting waterflows , and upon the other renewable forest resources .	The long-range objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management of the National Forest System under principles of multiple use and high-level sustained yield of products and services . This can be accomplished substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical fire periods , and a more intensive application of a program of prevention , detection , and control of insect and disease infestations . In addition to direct protection measures , more intensive management of timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and disease . Protection from insects and disease In the 10-year period , it is proposed that insect and disease control on the National Forest System be stepped up to a level of prevention , detection , and control of insect and disease infestations that will substantially reduce the occurrence of large infestations toward the end of the initial period . This will require about a 40 percent increase over the present level of protection . The work will consist of : 1 .Intensification of present activities through ( A ) quicker , more extensive , and more thorough surveys to detect incipient outbreaks ; ;( B ) more reliable evaluation of the potential of initial outbreaks to cause widespread damage ; ;( C ) quicker and more effective control action in the initial stages to prevent a large-scale epidemic . The initial suppression activities would cover about twice the acreage currently being treated . 2 .Continuation of present blister rust control work plus extension of control to 250 , 000 acres not now protected but which should be managed for white pine production . The objective is to achieve sufficient effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance control will be needed . 3 .Initiating a program to control dwarf mistletoe on several hundred thousand acres of selected better stands of young softwood sawtimber on better growing sites . 4 .Coordination of pest control objectives with timber management activities to reduce losses . Protection from fire It is proposed that in 10 years all commercial timberlands , all critical watersheds , and other lands in the National Forest System developed or proposed for intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak loads . This will include 125 million acres compared with 23 million acres now receiving such protection . An additional 15 million acres will be given a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation .	Meeting these levels of protection from fire calls for : 1 .Expansion , modernization , and development of fire control to a proficiency and strength of force which will prevent as many fires as possible and suppress fires before they spread beyond permitted standards . This is to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present level of preventive effort , detection , skilled fire-fighting crews , and equipment use . This will include a stepped-up program of training and development of personnel . 2 .Adoption and use of new and modern techniques being developed for prevention , for suppression of fires while small , and for stopping large fires while running and burning intensely . 3 .Reduction of hazardous fuel conditions to minimize the chances of large fires developing and spreading to high-value areas . This work will cover the most serious one-fourth of all land needing such treatment , and will consist of burning 250 , 000 acres of highly hazardous debris concentration , felling snags on 350 , 000 acres of high lightning-occurrence areas , prescribed burning on 3 . 5 million acres , removing roadside fuel on 39 , 000 acres , and clearing and maintaining 11 , 000 miles of firebreaks . Protection from other damage Rodent control work for the 10-year period will be aimed at control of the most serious infestations of harmful rodents , such as porcupines and mice , on high-value areas of forage and commercial timberlands . These areas comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation on the National Forests . Approximately 1 . 8 million acres of rangelands and 9 . 4 million acres of timberlands would be treated in this period . Control would be limited to those rodents for which economical means of control are known .Roads and trails The transportation system which serves the National Forests is a complex of highways and access roads and trails under various ownerships and jurisdictions . This system is divided into a forest highway system , administered by the Secretary of Commerce , and a forest development road and trail system , administered by the Secretary of Agriculture . Both of these systems are essential for the production , development , and use of the National Forests .	In the forest highway system , there are now 24 , 400 miles of public roads . These are mostly through highways that carry traffic going from one destination to another . Because administration of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce with maintenance provided by the States and counties , this Development Program for the National Forests does not include estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system nor to construct the additions to it that are needed . It is estimated that about 70 , 000 miles of forest highways will eventually be needed to fully serve the National Forests .	In the forest development road and trail system , there are now 162 , 400 miles of roads and 106 , 500 miles of supplemental foot and horse trails . These roads are largely of less than highway standards , and usually carry traffic which is related to use of the National Forests . Construction and maintenance of this system is a responsibility of the Secretary of Agriculture . It is estimated that about 542 , 250 miles of forest development roads , and 80 , 000 miles of trails , constitute the system that will eventually be needed to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of the wood , water , forage , and wildlife and recreation resources of the National Forests on a continuing basis .	The ultimate trail system will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization and fire protection . It will be carefully planned to maintain optimum service to these important resources and watersheds .	The presence or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling influence on all phases of forest management and utilization such as : ( A ) the protection of forage , timber , and wildlife resources from fire , insects , and disease ; ;( B ) the balanced use of recreation , hunting , and fishing areas ; ;( C ) the volume of timber that can be marketed , especially for small sales and the support of dependent communities and small business enterprises ; ;( D ) the level of salvage cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity to promptly salvage losses resulting from fire , windstorm , insects , and disease ; ;( E ) the protection of watershed lands from erosion and overgrazing by animals .	The existence of road systems permits an intensity of management and use for all National Forest purposes that is not otherwise possible . Furthermore , roads that give access to National Forest timber are investments which pay their own way over a period of years . Use of these roads by the public results in substantial benefits to the localities the roads serve .	The long-range objective of this Department is to provide and maintain a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately service the National Forest System at the levels needed to meet expected needs and optimum production of products and services . For the year 2000 this means servicing ( A ) the protection requirements of a watershed producing at least 200 million acre-feet of water each year , ( B ) recreation and wildlife resources used each year by 635 million visitors , ( C ) a timber resource supporting an annual cut of 21 billion board feet , and ( D ) 60 million acres of rangelands .	Service at these levels of production and utilization will eventually require the construction of about 379 , 900 miles of new roads and 6 , 000 miles of new trails , along with the reconstruction to higher standards of about 105 , 000 miles of roads and 10 , 500 miles of trails . About 26 , 500 miles of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of new roads . About 80 percent of these long-range requirements should be met by the year 2000 .	Program proposals for forest development roads and trails for the 10-year period 1963-1972 are as follows : 1 .Complete the construction and reconstruction of about 79 , 400 miles of multiple-purpose roads and 8 , 000 miles of trails . This constitutes about 17 percent of the long-range requirements for these facilities .	Approximately 40 percent of the value of the work on roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed by purchasers of National Forest timber , but paid for by the Government through adjustment of stumpage prices . 2 .Provide maintenance to full standards on the 268 , 900 miles of existing access roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during the period .Land adjustment , land purchase , land use Within the units in the National Forest System the pattern of land ownership is quite irregular . In some units , National Forest ownership is well blocked together . In many others , the previous patenting of land under the public land laws , or the way in which land was available for purchase , resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership .	Within exterior boundaries of National Forests and National Grasslands , there are about 40 , 000 , 000 acres in non-Federal ownership . One consequence is the occurrence of occasional conflicts because private owners of some inholdings object to public programs of use on neighboring National Forest or other Federal land , or because such ownerships are developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public of neighboring National Forest land . Some privately held inholdings are a source of direct damage to these Federal lands . And some , which are suitable for tree growing and for other National Forest purposes , are unmanaged or in need of expensive rehabilitation , and are contributing nothing to the economy ; ; there are no reasonable prospects that these conditions will be corrected or changed . Lands in this last category are situated largely in the mountainous portions of the Eastern States .	The long-range objective is to bring about consolidation of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tracts for recognized National Forest programs such as recreation development , or which are a source of damage to lands in National Forests and National Grasslands .
	Strategy and tactics of the U . S . military forces are now undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history . The change of emphasis from conventional-type to missile-type warfare must be made with care , mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in favor of the other . Our military forces must be capable of contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon us , from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war .Forces and military personnel strength .-- This budget will provide in the fiscal year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately the present level -- a year-end strength of 2 , 489 , 000 men and women in the active forces . The forces to be supported include an Army of 14 divisions and 870 , 000 men ; ; a Navy of 817 active ships and 619 , 000 men ; ; a Marine Corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with 175 , 000 men ; ; and an Air Force of 91 combat wings and 825 , 000 men .	If the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war , their basic organization and objectives must conform to the changing character and missions of the active forces . Quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere numbers . Under modern conditions , this is especially true of the ready reserve . I have requested the Secretary of Defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare .	Last year the Congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the Army Reserve . Similar restrictions on the strength of the Army National Guard contained in the 1960 Department of Defense Appropriation Act should likewise be dropped . I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity .	I again proposed a reduction in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve -- from their present strengths of 400 , 000 and 300 , 000 , respectively , to 360 , 000 and 270 , 000 by the end of the fiscal year 1961 . These strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives .Military personnel costs .-- About 30% of the expenditures for the Department of Defense in 1961 are for military personnel costs , including pay for active , reserve , and retired military personnel . These expenditures are estimated to be $12 . 1 billion , an increase of $187 million over 1960 , reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel , more dependents , an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay , and social security tax increases ( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 ) . Retired pay costs are increased by $94 million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel . These increased costs are partially offset by a decrease of $56 million in expenditures for the reserve forces , largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the Army Reserve components during 1961 .	Traditionally , rates of pay for retired military personnel have been proportionate to current rates of pay for active personnel . The 1958 military pay act departed from this established formula by providing for a 6% increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of June 1 , 1958 . I endorse pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay rates .Operation and maintenance .-- Expenditures for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the Armed Forces are estimated to be $10 . 3 billion in 1961 , which is $184 million more than in 1960 . The increase stems largely from the growing complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment .	A substantial increase is estimated in the cost of operating additional communications systems in the air defense program , as well as in all programs where speed and security of communications are essential . Also , the program for fleet modernization will be stepped up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures . Further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the Congress last year .	Other factors increasing operating costs include the higher unit cost of each flying hour , up 11% in two years , and of each steaming hour , up 15% . In total , these increases in operating costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures , such as reduced numbers of units and installations , smaller inventories of major equipment , and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed Forces .	In the budget message for 1959 , and again for 1960 , I recommended immediate repeal of section 601 of the Act of September 28 , 1951 ( 65 Stat . 365 ) . This section prevents the military departments and the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization from carrying out certain transactions involving real property unless they come into agreement with the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives . As I have stated previously , the Attorney General has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles . Accordingly , if it is not repealed by the Congress at its present session , I shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the Secretary of Defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise .	Basic long-line communications in Alaska are now provided through Federal facilities operated by the Army , Air Force , and Federal Aviation Agency . The growing communications needs of this new State can best be met , as they have in other States , through the operation and development of such facilities by private enterprise . Legislation has already been proposed to authorize the sale of these Government-owned systems in Alaska , and its early enactment is desirable .Procurement , research , and construction .-- Approximately 45% of the expenditures for the Department of Defense are for procurement , research , development , and construction programs . In 1961 , these expenditures are estimated at $18 . 9 billion , compared to $19 . 3 billion in 1960 . The decreases , which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement , are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks , vehicles , guns , and electronic devices . Expenditures for shipbuilding are estimated at about the same level as in 1960 .	New obligational authority for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement ( excluding amounts for related research and construction ) totals $4 , 753 million , which is $1 , 390 million below that enacted for 1960 . On the other hand , the new authority of $3 , 825 million proposed for missile procurement ( excluding research and construction ) in 1961 is $581 million higher than for 1960 . These contrasting trends in procurement reflect the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our Armed Forces in the years ahead .	The Department of Defense appropriation acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain military supply items . As I have repeatedly stated , this provision is much more restrictive than the general law , popularly known as the Buy American Act . I urge once again that the Congress not reenact this rider .	The task of providing a reasonable level of military strength , without endangering other vital aspects of our security , is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress . The last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history . Some weapons systems have become obsolescent while still in production , and some while still under development .	Furthermore , unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological break-through on any one weapon system , in itself , often diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems . This has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense program in order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems which have been overtaken by events . Thus , in the last few years , a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was commenced have since been completely eliminated . For example , the importance of the Regulus 2 , a very promising aerodynamic ship-to-surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines , was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced Polaris ballistic missile launched by submerged submarines .	Another example is the recent cancellation of the F-108 , a long-range interceptor with a speed three times as great as the speed of sound , which was designed for use against manned bombers in the period of the mid-1960 ' s . The substantial progress being made in ballistic missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned bombers to missiles . Considering the high cost of the F-108 system -- over $4 billion for the force that had been planned -- and the time period in which it would become operational , it was decided to stop further work on the project . Meanwhile , other air defense forces are being made effective , as described later in this message .	The size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans . Notable in this category are the Jupiter and Thor intermediate range ballistic missiles , which have been successfully developed , produced , and deployed , but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile .	The impact of technological factors is also illustrated by the history of the high-energy fuel program . This project was started at a time when there was a critical need for a high-energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance aircraft , particularly our heavy bombers . Continuing technical problems involved in the use of this fuel , coupled with significant improvements in aircraft range through other means , have now raised serious questions about the value of the high-energy fuel program . As a result , the scope of this project has been sharply curtailed .	These examples underscore the importance of even more searching evaluations of new major development programs and even more penetrating and far-ranging analyses of the potentialities of future technology . The cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development , in determining the most satisfactory rate of development , and in deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it .Strategic forces .-- The deterrent power of our Armed Forces comes from both their nuclear retaliatory capability and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any form of war . The first capability is represented by a combination of manned bombers , carrier-based aircraft , and intercontinental and intermediate range missiles . The second capability is represented by our deployed ground , naval , and air forces in essential forward areas , together with ready reserves capable of effecting early emergency reinforcement .	The Strategic Air Command is the principal element of our long-range nuclear capability . One of the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role of the B-70 , a long-range supersonic bomber . This aircraft , which was planned for initial operational use about 1965 , would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile systems , all of which are scheduled to become available earlier . The first Atlas ICBM ' s are now operational , the first two Polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar year , and the first Titan ICBM ' s next year . The Minuteman solid-fueled ICBM is planned to be operational about mid-1963 . By 1965 , several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and their reliability established .	Thus , the need for the B-70 as a strategic weapon system is doubtful . However , I am recommending that development work on the B-70 air-frame and engines be continued . It is expected that in 1963 two prototype aircraft will be available for flight testing . By that time we should be in a much better position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon system .	I am recommending additional acquisitions of the improved version of the B-52 ( the B-52H with the new turbofan engine ) and procurement of the B-58 supersonic medium bomber , together with the supporting refueling tankers in each case . These additional modern bombers will replace some of the older B-47 medium bombers ; ; one B-52 can do the work of several B-47 ' s which it will replace . Funds are also included in this budget to continue the equipping of the B-52 wings with the Hound Dog air-to-surface missile .	In the coming fiscal year additional quantities of Atlas , Titan , and Polaris missiles also will be procured .
Purchase authorizations will include provisions relating to the sale and delivery of commodities , including the classes , types and varieties of food grain , the time and circumstances of deposit of the rupees accruing from such sale , and other relevant matters . 3 .The United States recognizes the desire of India to accumulate , as quickly as possible , a substantial part of the one million ton reserve stock of rice provided for in this Agreement to assist in stabilizing the internal markets for this commodity in India . Under this Agreement the first annual review of rice availabilities will be made in August 1960 . At that time consideration will be given to whether in the light of the United States supplies of rice available for Title 1 , disposal , India ' s production , consumption and stocks of food grains , other imports from the United States and countries friendly to the United States , India ' s storage capacity , and other related factors , any increase would be possible in the portion of the total rice programmed which is currently planned for procurement during the first year . 4 .The two Governments agree that the issuance of purchase authorizations for wheat and rice providing for purchase after June 30 , 1961 , shall be dependent upon the determination by the United States Government that these commodities are in surplus supply and available under Title 1 , of the Act at that time . The United States Government shall have the right to terminate the financing of further sales under this Agreement of any commodity if it determines at any time after June 30 , 1961 , that such action is necessitated by the existence of an international emergency .Article 2 , uses of rupees 1 .The two Governments agree that the rupees accruing to the Government of the United States of America as a consequence of sales made pursuant to this Agreement will be used by the Government of the United States of America , in such manner and order of priority as the Government of the United States of America shall determine , for the following purposes in the amounts shown : ( A ) For United States expenditures under subsections ( A ) , ( B ) , ( D ) , ( E ) , ( F ) , ( H ) through ( R ) of Section 104 of the Act or under any of such subsections , the rupee equivalent of $200 million .( B ) For grant to the Government of India under subsection ( E ) of Section 104 of the Act , the rupee equivalent of not more than $538 million for financing such projects to promote balanced economic development as may from time to time be mutually agreed .( C ) For loan to the Government of India under subsection ( G ) of Section 104 of the Act , the rupee equivalent of not more than $538 million for financing such projects to promote balanced economic development as may be mutually agreed . The terms and conditions of the loan and other provisions will be set forth in a separate agreement by the two Governments .	In the event that agreement is not reached on the use of the rupees for grant or loan purposes within six years from the date of this Agreement , the Government of the United States of America may use the local currency for any purposes authorized by Section 104 of the Act . 2 .In the event the total of rupees accruing to the Government of the United States of America as a consequence of sales made pursuant to this Agreement is different from the rupee equivalent of $1 , 276 million , the amounts available for the purposes specified in paragraph 1 , Article 2 , will be adjusted proportionately .Article 3 , deposit of rupees The deposit of rupees to the account of the Government of the United States of America in payment for the commodities and for ocean transportation costs financed by the Government of the United States of America ( except excess costs resulting from the requirement that United States flag vessels be used ) shall be made at the rate of exchange for United States dollars generally applicable to import transactions ( excluding imports granted a preferential rate ) in effect on the dates of dollar disbursement by United States banks , or by the Government of the United States of America , as provided in the purchase authorizations .Article 4 , general undertakings 1 .The Government of India agrees that it will take all possible measures to prevent the resale or transshipment to other countries or the use for other than domestic purposes ( except where such resale , transshipment or use is specifically approved by the Government of the United States of America ) , of the surplus agricultural commodities purchased pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement , and to assure that the purchase of such commodities does not result in increased availability of these or like commodities for export from India . 2 .The two Governments agree that they will take reasonable precautions to assure that all sales or purchases of surplus agricultural commodities , pursuant to the Agreement will not displace usual marketings of the United States of America in these commodities , or unduly disrupt world prices of agricultural commodities or normal patterns of commercial trade with friendly countries . 3 .In carrying out this Agreement , the two Governments will seek to assure , to the extent practicable , conditions of commerce permitting private traders to function effectively and will use their best endeavors to develop and extend continuous market demand for agricultural commodities . 4 .The Government of India agrees to furnish , upon request of the United States of America , information on the progress of the program , particularly with respect to the arrival and condition of commodities and the provisions for the maintenance of usual marketings , and information relating to exports of the same or like commodities .Article 5 , consultation The two Governments will , upon the request of either of them , consult regarding any matter relating to the application of this Agreement or to the operation of arrangements carried out pursuant to this Agreement .Article 6 , entry into force The agreement shall enter into force upon signature .	In witness whereof , the respective representatives , duly authorized for the purpose , have signed the present Agreement .	Done at Washington in duplicate this fourth day of May 1960 .	For the government of the United States of America : 	Dwight D . Eisenhower 	for the government of India : 	S . K . Patil Excellency : 	I have the honor to refer to the Agricultural Commodities Agreement signed today between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of India ( hereinafter referred to as the Agreement ) and , with regard to the rupees accruing to uses indicated under Article 2 , of the Agreement , to state that the understanding of the Government of the United States of America is as follows : 1 .With respect to Article 2 , , Paragraph 1 ( A ) of the Agreement : ( 1 ) The Government of India will provide facilities for the conversions of the rupee equivalent of $4 million ( up to a maximum of $1 million per year ) accruing under the subject agreement for agricultural market development purposes into currencies other than United States dollars on request of the Government of the United States of America . This facility is needed for the purpose of securing funds to finance agricultural market development activities of the Government of the United States in other countries .	The Government of the United States of America may utilize rupees in India to pay for goods and services , including international transportation needed in connection with market development and other agricultural projects and activities in India and other countries .( 2 ) The rupee equivalent of $63 . 8 million , but not more than 5 percent of the currencies received under the Agreement will be used for loans to be made by the Export-Import Bank of Washington under Section 104 ( E ) of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act , as amended ( hereinafter referred to as the Act ) , and for administrative expenses of the Export-Import Bank of Washington in India incident thereto . It is understood that : ( A ) Such loans under Section 104 ( E ) of the Act will be made to United States business firms and branches , subsidiaries , or affiliates of such firms in India for business development and trade expansion in India and to United States firms and to Indian firms for the establishment of facilities for aiding in the utilization , distribution , or otherwise increasing the consumption of and markets for United States agricultural products . In the event the rupees set aside for loans under Section 104 ( E ) of the Act are not advanced within six years from the date of this Agreement because the Export-Import Bank of Washington has not approved loans or because proposed loans have not been mutually agreeable to the Export-Import Bank of Washington and the Department of Economic Affairs of the Government of India , the Government of the United States of America may use the rupees for any purpose authorized by Section 104 of the Act .( B ) Loans will be mutually agreeable to the Export-Import Bank of Washington and the Government of India acting through the Department of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Finance . The Secretary , Department of Economic Affairs , or his designate , will act for the Government of India , and the President of the Export-Import Bank of Washington , or his designate , will act for the Export-Import Bank of Washington .( C ) Upon receipt of an application which the Export-Import Bank is prepared to consider , the Export-Import Bank will inform the Department of Economic Affairs of the identity of the applicant , the nature of the proposed business , the amount of the proposed loan , and the general purposes for which the loan proceeds would be expended .( D ) When the Export-Import Bank is prepared to act favorably upon an application , it will so notify the Department of Economic Affairs and will indicate the interest rate and the repayment period which would be used under the proposed loan . The interest rate will be similar to those prevailing in India on comparable loans and the maturities will be consistent with the purposes of the financing .( E ) Within sixty days after the receipt of notice that the Export-Import Bank is prepared to act favorably upon an application the Department of Economic Affairs will indicate to the Export-Import Bank whether or not the Department of Economic Affairs has any objection to the proposed loan . Unless within the sixty-day period the Export-Import Bank has received such a communication from the Department of Economic Affairs it shall be understood that the Department of Economic Affairs has no objection to the proposed loan . When the Export-Import Bank approves or declines the proposed loan , it will notify the Department of Economic Affairs . 2 .With respect to Article 2 , , paragraphs 1 ( B ) and 1 ( C ) : Uses of Section 104 ( E ) and Section 104 ( G ) rupees : The Government of India will use the amount of rupees granted or loaned to it by the United States pursuant to paragraphs 1 ( B ) and 1 ( C ) for projects to promote economic development with emphasis upon the agricultural sector including food reserve storage structures and facilities as may from time to time be agreed upon by the authorized representatives of the United States and the authorized representatives of the Government of India , in the following sectors : A .Agriculture ; ; B .Industry , including the production of fertilizer , irrigation and power , transport and communications , and credit institutions ; ; C .Public health , education , and rehabilitation ; ; D .Other economic development projects consistent with the purposes of Sections 104 ( E ) and 104 ( G ) of the Act . The Government of India further agrees in cooperation with the Government of the United States , to coordinate the use of grant and loan funds provided for in paragraphs 1 ( B ) and 1 ( C ) of Article 2 , with such direct dollar assistance as may be made available by the Government of the United States of America , so that both sources of financing may be channeled to specific and clearly identifiable economic development programs and projects . 3 .It is agreed that any goods delivered or services rendered after the date of this agreement for projects within categories A , B , and C under paragraph 2 above which may later be approved by the United States will be eligible for financing from currency granted or loaned to the Government of India . 4 .With regard to the rupees accruing to uses indicated under Article 2 , of the Agreement , the understanding of the Government of the United States of America , with respect to both paragraphs 1 ( B ) and 1 ( C ) of Article 2 , is as follows : ( 1 ) Local currency will be advanced or reimbursed to the Government of India for financing agreed projects under paragraphs 1 ( B ) and 1 ( C ) of Article 2 , of the Agreement upon the presentation of such documentation as the United States may specify .( 2 ) The Government of India shall maintain or cause to be maintained books and records adequate to identify the goods and services financed for agreed projects pursuant to paragraphs 1 ( B ) and 1 ( C ) of Article 2 , of the Agreement , to disclose the use thereof in the projects and to record the progress of the projects ( including the cost thereof ) . The books and records with respect to each project shall be maintained for the duration of the project , or until the expiration of three years after final disbursement for the project has been made by the United States , whichever is later . The two Governments shall have the right at all reasonable times to examine such books and records and all other documents , correspondence , memoranda and other records involving transactions relating to agreed projects . The Government of India shall enable the authorized representatives of the United States to observe and review agreed projects and the utilization of goods and services financed under the projects , and shall furnish to the United States all such information as it shall reasonably request concerning the above-mentioned matters and the expenditures related thereto .
This broad delegation leaves within our discretion ( subject to the always-present criterion of the public interest ) both the determination of what degree of interference shall be considered excessive , and the methods by which such excessive interference shall be avoided . 3 .The present proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast ( AM ) band , from 540 kc . to 1600 kc . . Whenever two or more standard broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequencies , each interferes to some extent with reception of the other . The extent of such interference -- which may be so slight as to be undetectable at any point where either of the stations renders a usable signal , or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service areas of both stations -- depends on many factors , among the principal ones being the distance between the stations , their respective radiated power , and , of particular significance here , the time of day . Other factors playing a part in the extent of AM service and interference are the frequency involved , the time of year , the position of the year in the sunspot cycle , ground conductivity along the transmission path , atmospheric and manmade noise , and others . With the existence of these many factors , some of them variable , it obviously has never been and is not now possible for the Commission to make assignments of AM stations on a case-to-case basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstances . Rather , such assignments are made , as they must be , on the basis of certain overall rules and standards , representing to some extent a statistical approach to the problem , taking into account for each situation some of the variables ( e . g . , power and station separations ) and averaging out others in order to achieve the balance which must be struck between protection against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of stations large enough to afford optimum radio service to the Nation . An example of the overall standards applied is the 20-to-1 ratio established for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference which is regarded as objectionable . By this standard , it is determined that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved , objectionable interference from station A exists at any point within the service area of station B where station A ' s signal is of an intensity one-twentieth or more of the strength of station B ' s signal at that point . 4 .The 20-to-1 ratio for cochannel interference embodies one of the fundamental limiting principles which we must always take into account in AM assignments and allocations -- that signals from a particular station are potential sources of objectionable interference over an area much greater than that within which they provide useful service . A second fundamental principle is that involved particularly in the present proceeding -- the difference between nighttime and daytime propagation conditions with respect to the standard broadcast frequencies . This is a phenomenon familiar to all radio listeners , resulting from reflection of skywave signals at night from the ionized layer in the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere . All AM stations radiate both skywave and groundwave signals , at all hours ; ; but during the middle daytime hours these skywave radiations are not reflected in any substantial quantity , and during this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference are , in general , negligible . But during nighttime hours the skywave radiations are reflected from the ionosphere , thereby creating the possibility of one station ' s rendering service , via skywave , at a much greater distance than it can through its groundwave signal , and at the same time vastly complicating the interference problem because of the still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference to the signals of stations on the same and closely adjacent frequencies . Because of the difference between daytime and nighttime propagation conditions , it has been necessary to evolve different allocation structures for daytime and nighttime broadcasting in the AM band , with many more stations operating during the day than at night . 5 .It was recognized years ago that the transition from daytime to nighttime propagation conditions , and vice versa , is not an instantaneous process , but takes place over periods of time from roughly 2 hours before sunset until about 2 hours after sunset , and again from roughly 2 hours before sunrise until some 2 hours after sunrise . During the period of about 4 hours around sunset , skywave transmission conditions are building up until full nighttime conditions prevail ; ; during the same period around sunrise , skywave transmission is declining , until at about 2 hours after sunrise it reaches a point where it becomes of little practical significance . However , in this case as elsewhere it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to all situations , representing an averaging of conditions , and thus to fix particular points in time which would be considered the dividing points between daytime and nighttime conditions . It was determined that the hours of sunrise and sunset , respectively , should be used for this purpose . Accordingly , the 1938-39 rules adopted these hours as limitations upon the operation of daytime stations . Class 2 , stations operating on clear channels are required to cease operation or operate under nighttime restrictions beginning either at local sunset ( for daytime class 2 , stations ) or sunset at the location of the dominant class 1 , station where located west of the class 2 , station ( for limited-time class 2 , stations ) .	The same restrictions apply after local sunset in the case of class 3 , stations operating on regional channels , which after that time are required to operate under nighttime restrictions in order to protect each other . With respect to nighttime assignments , the degree of skywave service and interference is determined by skywave curves ( figs . 1 and 2 of sec . 3 . 190 of the rules ) giving average skywave values . These curves were derived by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data . It was recognized that skywave signals , because of their reflected nature , are of great variability and subject to wide fluctuations in strength . For this reason , the more uncertain skywave service was denominated `` secondary '' in our rules , as compared to the steadier , more reliable groundwave `` primary service '' , and , for both skywave service and skywave interference , signal strength is expressed in terms of percentage of time a particular signal-intensity level is exceeded -- 50 percent of the time for skywave service , 10 percent of the time for skywave interference .Allocation policies 6 .As mentioned , the allocation of AM stations represents a balance between protection against interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number of stations . The rules and policies to be applied in this process of course must be based on objectives which represent what is to be desired if radio service is to be of maximum use to the Nation . Our objectives , as we have stated many times , are -- ( 1 ) To provide some service to all listeners ; ;( 2 ) To provide as many choices of service to as many listeners as possible ; ;( 3 ) To provide service of local origin to as many listeners as possible . Since broadcast frequencies are very limited in number , these objectives are to some extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realized , and to the extent that each is realized , there is a corresponding reduction of the possibilities for fullest achievement of the others . Accordingly , the Commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern for other frequencies , and has assigned different frequencies for use by different classes of stations . Some 45 frequencies are assigned for use primarily by dominant Class 1 , -- A or Class 1 , -- B clear-channel stations , designed to operate with adequate power and to provide service -- both groundwave and ( at night ) skywave -- over large areas and at great distances , being protected against interference to the degree necessary to achieve this objective . In dealing with these frequencies , the objective listed first above -- provision of service to all listeners -- was predominant ; ; the other objectives were subordinated to it . The class 1 , stations on these clear channels are protected to their 0 . 1-mv . groundwave contours against daytime cochannel interference . With respect to skywave service rendered at night , class 1 , -- A stations are the only stations permitted to operate in the United States on clear channels specified for class 1 , -- A operation , and so render skywave service free from cochannel interference whereever they may be received ; ; class 1 , -- B stations are protected at night to their 0 . 5-mv . 50-percent time skywave contours against cochannel interference . Since the provision of skywave service requires adequate freedom from interference , only class 1 , stations are capable of rendering skywave service . But nighttime operation by stations of other classes of course entails skywave interference to groundwave service , interference which is substantial unless steps are taken to minimize it . 7 .With respect to other frequencies , these are designated as regional or local , and assigned for use by class 3 , and class 4 , stations , respectively , stations operating generally with lower power . In the allocation pattern worked out for these frequencies , the provision of long-range service has to some extent been subordinated to the other two objectives -- assignment of multiple facilities , and assignment of stations in as many communities as possible . 8 .As mentioned , the primary allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations on clear channels is the provision of widespread service , free from destructive interference . During nighttime hours , because of the intense skywave propagation then prevailing , no large number of stations can be permitted to operate on one of these channels , if the wide area service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render it . Therefore , under our longstanding allocation rules , on some of these channels no station other than the dominant ( class 1 ) -- A ) station is permitted to operate at night , so that the 1 , -- A station can render service , interference free , wherever it can be received . On the remainder of the clear channels , the dominant ( class 1 ) -- B stations are protected as described above , and the relatively small number of secondary ( class 2 ) ) stations permitted to operate on these channels at night are required to operate directionally and with reduced power so as to protect the class 1 , stations . In the daytime , on the other hand , since skywave transmission is relatively inefficient , it is possible to assign a substantially larger number of stations on these channels . Additional class 2 , assignments for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference to the class 1 , stations or to each other , and by their operation provide additional service on these channels and additional local outlets for a large number of communities . Such additional daytime class 2 , assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made of these frequencies , and the Commission has over the years made a large number of them . Similarly , on the regional channels many class 3 , stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate nighttime with directional antennas and lower power . 9 .Essentially , the question presented for decision in the present Daytime Skywave proceeding is whether our decision ( in 1938-1939 ) to assign stations on the basis of daytime conditions from sunrise to sunset , is sound as a basis for AM allocations , or whether , in the light of later developments and new understanding , skywave transmission is of such significance during the hours immediately before sunset and after sunrise that this condition should be taken into account , and some stations required to afford protection to other stations during these hours .The history of the proceeding 10 .The decision reached in 1938-39 was made after the accumulation of a large amount of data and thorough study thereof . Since then , there has been a notable increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it , leading to a better understanding of propagation phenomena . In 1947 , affidavits were filed with the Commission by various clear-channel stations alleging that extensive interference was being caused to the service areas of these stations during daylight hours , from class 2 , stations whose signals were being reflected from the ionosphere so as to create skywave intereference .
If you elect to use the Standard Deduction or the Tax Table , and later find you should have itemized your deductions , you may do so by filing an amended return within the time prescribed for filing a claim for refund . See You May Claim A Refund , Page 135 . The same is true if you have itemized your deductions and later decide you should have used the Standard Deduction or Tax Table . The words amended return should be plainly written across the top of such return . When and where to file April 15 is usually the final date for filing income tax returns for most people because they use the calendar year ending on December 31 . If you use a fiscal year , a year ending on the last day of any month other than December , your return is due on or before the 15th day of the 4th month after the close of your tax year . Saturday , Sunday , or holiday .If the last day ( due date ) for performing any act for tax purposes , such as filing a return or making a tax payment , etc . , falls on Saturday , Sunday , or a legal holiday , you may perform that act on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday , Sunday , or legal holiday . Since April 15 , 1962 , is on Sunday your return for the calendar year 1961 will be timely filed if it is filed on or before Monday , April 16 , 1962 .	If you mail A return or tax payment , you must place it in the mails in ample time to reach the district director on or before the due date . Declaration of estimated tax .If you were required to file a declaration of estimated tax for the calendar year 1961 , it is not necessary to pay the fourth installment otherwise due on January 15 , 1962 , if you file your income tax return Form 1040 , and pay your tax in full for the calendar year 1961 by January 31 , 1962 . The filing of an original or amended declaration , otherwise due on January 15 , 1962 , is also waived , if you file your Form 1040 for 1961 and pay the full tax by January 31 , 1962 . Farmers , for these purposes , have until February 15 , 1962 , to file Form 1040 and pay the tax in full for the calendar year 1961 . Fiscal year taxpayers have until the last day of the first month following the close of the fiscal year ( farmers until the 15th day of the 2d month ) . See Chapter 38 .	Nonresident aliens living in Canada or Mexico who earn wages in the United States may be subject to withholding of tax on their wages , the same as if they were citizens of the United States . Their United States tax returns are due April 16 , 1962 . However , if their United States income is not subject to the withholding of tax on wages , their returns are due June 15 , 1962 , if they use a calendar year , or the 15th day of the 6th month after the close of their fiscal year . Nonresident aliens in Puerto Rico .If you are a nonresident alien and a resident of Puerto Rico , your return is also due June 15 , 1962 , or the 15th day of the 6th month after the close of your fiscal year .	If A taxpayer dies , the executor , administrator , or legal representative must file the final return for the decedent on or before the 15th day of the 4th month following the close of the deceased taxpayer ' s normal tax year . Suppose John Jones , who , for 1960 , filed on the basis of a calendar year , died June 20 , 1961 . His return for the period January 1 to June 20 , 1961 , is due April 16 , 1962 .	The return for a decedent may also serve as a claim for refund of an overpayment of tax . In such a case , Form 1310 should be completed and attached to the return . This form may be obtained from the local office of your district director .	Returns of estates or trusts are due on or before the 15th day of the 4th month after the close of the tax year . Extensions of time for filing .Under unusual circumstances a resident individual may be granted an extension of time to file a return . You may apply for such an extension by filing Form 2688 , Application For Extension Of Time To File , with the District Director of Internal Revenue for your district , or you may make your application in a letter . Your application must include the following information : ( 1 ) your reasons for requesting an extension , ( 2 ) whether you filed timely income tax returns for the 3 preceding years , and ( 3 ) whether you were required to file an estimated return for the year , and if so whether you did file and have paid the estimated tax payments on or before the due dates . Any failure to file timely returns or make estimated tax payments when due must be fully explained . Extensions are not granted as a matter of course , and the reasons for your request must be substantial . If you are unable to sign the request , because of illness or other good cause , another person who stands in close personal or business relationship to you may sign the request on your behalf , stating the reason why you are unable to sign . You should make any request for an extension early so that if it is refused , your return may still be on time . See also Interest On Unpaid Taxes , below . Extensions while abroad .Citizens of the United States who , on April 15 , are not in the United States or Puerto Rico , are allowed an extension of time until June 15 for filing the return for the preceding calendar year . An extension of 2 months beyond the regular due date for filing is also available to taxpayers making returns for a fiscal year . Alaska and Hawaii .Taxpayers residing or traveling in Alaska are also allowed this extension of time for filing , but those residing or traveling in Hawaii are not allowed this automatic extension .	Military or Naval Personnel on duty in Alaska or outside the United States and Puerto Rico are also allowed this automatic extension of time for filing their returns .	You must attach a statement to your return , if you take advantage of this automatic extension , showing that you were in Alaska or were outside the United States or Puerto Rico on April 15 or other due date . Interest on unpaid taxes .Interest at the rate of 6% a year must be paid on taxes that are not paid on or before their due date . Such interest must be paid even though an extension of time for filing is granted . When payment is due .If your computation on Form 1040 or Form 1040A shows you owe additional tax , it should be remitted with your return unless you owe less than $1 , in which case it is forgiven . If payment is by cash , you should ask for a receipt . If you file Form 1040A and the District Director computes your tax , you will be sent a bill if additional tax is due . This bill should be paid within 30 days . Payment by check or money order .Whether the check is certified or uncertified , the tax is not paid until the check is paid . If the check is not good and the April 15 or other due date deadline elapses , additions to the tax may be incurred . Furthermore , a bad check may subject the maker to certain penalties . All checks and money orders should be made payable to Internal Revenue Service . Refunds .An overpayment of income and social security taxes entitles you to a refund unless you indicate on the return that the overpayment should be applied to your succeeding year ' s estimated tax .	If you file Form 1040A and the District Director computes your tax , any refund to which you are entitled will be mailed to you .	If you file a Form 1040 , you should indicate in the place provided that there is an overpayment of tax and the amount you want refunded and the amount you want credited against your estimated tax .	Refunds of less than $1 will not be made unless you attach a separate application to your return requesting such a refund . Where to file .Send your return to the Director of Internal Revenue for the district in which you have your legal residence or principal place of business . If you have neither a legal residence nor a principal place of business in any Internal Revenue district , your return should be filed with the District Director of Internal Revenue , Baltimore 2 , Md . . If your principal place of abode for the tax year is outside the United States ( including Alaska and Hawaii ) , Puerto Rico , or the Virgin Islands and you have no legal residence or principal place of business in any Internal Revenue district in the United States , you should file your return with the Office of International Operations , Internal Revenue Service , Washington 25 , D . C . . Adjusted gross income . The deductions allowed in determining Adjusted Gross Income put all taxpayers on a comparable basis . It is the amount you enter on line 9 , page 1 of Form 1040 . Some deductions are subtracted from Gross Income to determine Adjusted Gross Income . Other deductions are subtracted only from Adjusted Gross Income in arriving at Taxable Income .	To compute your adjusted gross income you total all items of income .( See Chapter 6 .) From this amount deduct the items indicated below .	Businessmen deduct all ordinary and necessary expenses attributable to a trade or business . Rents or royalties .If you hold property for the production of rents or royalties you subtract , in computing Adjusted Gross Income , ordinary and necessary expenses and certain other deductions attributable to the property .( See Chapter 15 .) 	Outside salesmen deduct all expenses attributable to earning a salary , commission , or other compensation .( See Chapter 10 .) 	Employees deduct expenses of travel , meals and lodging while away from home in connection with the performance of their services as employees . They also deduct transportation expenses incurred in connection with the performance of services as employees even though they are not away from home .( See Chapter 12 .) If your employer reimburses you for expenses incurred , you deduct such expenses if they otherwise qualify .( See Chapter 10 .) 	Sick pay , if included in your Gross Income , is deducted in arriving at Adjusted Gross Income . If your sick pay is not included in your Gross Income , you may not deduct it .( See Chapter 9 .) income from estates and trusts .If you are a life tenant , you deduct allowable depreciation and depletion . If you are an income beneficiary of property held in trust or an heir , legatee , or devisee , you may deduct allowable depreciation and depletion , if not deductible by the estate or trust .	Deductible losses on sales or exchanges of property are allowable in determining your Adjusted Gross Income .( See Chapter 20 .) 50% of capital gains .You also deduct 50% of the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses in determining Adjusted Gross Income .( See Chapter 24 .) other deductions .Certain other deductions are not allowed in determining Adjusted Gross Income . They may be claimed only by itemizing them on page 2 of Form 1040 . These deductions may not be claimed if you elect to use the Standard Deduction or Tax Table .( See Chapters 30 through 37 .) 2 . Minors minors must also file returns if they earn $600 or more during the year .A minor is subject to tax on his own earnings even though his parent may , under local law , have the right to them and might actually have received the money . His income is not required to be included in the return of his parent .	A minor child is allowed A personal exemption of $600 on his own return regardless of how much money he may earn . Exemption also allowed parent .If your child is under 19 or is a student you may also claim an exemption for him if he qualifies as your dependent , even though he earns $600 or more . See Chapter 5 . Example .Your 16 year old son earned $720 in 1961 . You spent $800 for his support . Since he had gross income of $600 or more , he must file a return in which he may claim an exemption deduction of $600 . Since you contributed more than half of his support , you may also claim an exemption for him on your return . He may get a tax refund .A minor who has gross income of less than $600 is entitled to a refund if income tax was withheld from his wages . Generally , the refund may be obtained by filing Form 1040A accompanied by the withholding statement ( Form W-2 ) . If he had income other than wages subject to withholding , he may be required to file Form 1040 . See Chapter 1 .	If your child works for you , you may deduct reasonable wages you paid to him for services he rendered in your business . You may deduct these payments even though your child uses the money to purchase his own clothing or other necessities which you are normally obligated to furnish him , and even though you may be entitled to his services .
The one- or two-season hunt , of which there have been too many recently , may do more harm than good ; ; for such programs raise hopes of assistance toward achieving excellence in scholarship and the arts which are dashed when the programs are discontinued ; ; and they are dashed , no less , by lack of skill in making selections of men and women for development toward the highest reaches of the mind and spirit .	For the making of selections on the basis of excellence requires that any foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments of a corps of advisors whose judgments are known to be good : such judgments can be known to be good only by the records of those selected , by records made subsequent to their selection over considerable periods of time .	The central group of the Foundation ' s advisors are , at any one period of time , the members of our Advisory Board , consisting , now , of thirty-six men and women . They are chosen by the Foundation ' s Board of Trustees on the bases of their own first-rate accomplishments in their different fields of scholarship and the arts . Their locations in all parts of the United States , and their locations in the several kinds of educational and research institutions that are the principal homes of our intellectual and artistic strengths also are factors in the Trustees ' minds . For this concept of an Advisory Board , ancillary to the Board of Trustees , we are indebted to the late President of Harvard University , A . Lawrence Lowell , a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institutions and their administration . That we had the wit and wisdom to adopt Mr . Lowell ' s concept and make it the base for our processes of selection is one reason why our selections have been , it may be said truly , pretty uniformly good .	For , in accordance with Mr . Lowell ' s concept of an advisory board , our selections are made by experienced selectors who give both constancy and consistency to our processes and our choices . And lest we should become too consistent , in the sense of becoming heedless of new fields of scholarship and new points of view in the arts , the Foundation ' s Board of Trustees maintains a trickle -- not a flow ! !-- of new members through the Advisory Board .	Two committees of members of the Advisory Board constitute the committees of selection -- one for the selection of Fellows from Canada , the United States , and the English-speaking Caribbean area and one for the selection of Fellows from the Latin American republics and the Republic of the Philippines .	To the members of our Advisory Board , and most specially to its members who constitute our committees of selection , the Foundation is indebted for its successes of choice of Fellows . We are , as we know , utterly dependent on the quality of advice we get ; ; and quality of advice , added to devotion to the Foundation ' s purposes and ideals , we do get from our Advisory Board in measures so full that they can be appreciated only by those of us who work here every day .	But the facts about our Advisory Board and its members ' duties are only one of several sets of facts about the quest for advice , both reliable and imaginative , on which to base our selections of Fellows . For example , the interest of past members of the Foundation ' s Advisory Board remains such that they place their knowledge and judgments at our disposal much as they had done when they were , formally , members of that Board . And , besides , there are a large number of scholars , artists , composers of music , novelists , poets , essayists , choreographers , lawyers , servants of government , and men of affairs -- hundreds , indeed -- who serve the Foundation well with the advice they give us freely and gratis out of their experience .	To all , the Foundation gives the kind of thanks which are more than thanks : to them we are grateful beyond the possibility of conveying in words how grateful we are .It is a truism of business that no business can be better than its board of directors and its top management . The same is true of every foundation . During the biennium reviewed in this Report , our Board of Trustees named able men , younger than the rest of us , to the Board and to top management to insure future continuance of the first-class administration of the Foundation ' s affairs : 	Dr . James Brown Fisk , physicist , President of the Bell Telephone Laboratories , was elected to the Board of Trustees . He is a member both of the National Academy of Sciences and of the American Philosophical Society ; ; and he has served our country well as a scientific statesman on international commissions .	Dr . Gordon N . Ray , Provost , Vice-President and Professor of English in the University of Illinois , was appointed Associate Secretary General . The Trustees of the Foundation appointed Dr . Ray to that position with the stated expectation that he would succeed the present Secretary General upon the latter ' s eventual retirement . Dr . Ray is a Fellow of the Foundation -- appointed thrice to assist his studies of William Makepeace Thackeray and of H . G . Wells -- and , before his appointment to the Foundation ' s executive staff , had been given our highest scholarly accolade , appointment to the Advisory Board .	Referring further to the Foundation ' s officers , Dr . James F . Mathias , for eleven years our discerning colleague as Associate Secretary , was promoted to be Secretary . He is a historian , with the great merit of a historian ' s long view .	Also appointed to the Foundation ' s staff , as Assistant Secretary , is Mr . J . Kellum Smith , Jr . . Mr . Smith , like the present Secretary General , is a lawyer ; ; and lawyers -- with the great virtues that they are trained to read `` the fine print '' carefully and are able out of professional experience to arrive at imaginative solutions to difficult problems in many fields -- are indispensable even in a foundation office .	The present Secretary General has been the Foundation ' s principal administrative officer continuously since the Foundation ' s establishment thirty-five years ago . But even he will not last indefinitely and the above-noted new arrangements are , quite simply , made to assure qualitative continuity in the Foundation ' s policies and practices . The effective recognition of excellence and its nurture has to be learned and is not learned in a day , nor even in a year .We are not given to lamentations , neither personally nor in these Reports . On the contrary , if this be an apocalyptic era as is commonly said , we see it as an era of opportunity . For , granting that there are great present-day problems to be solved , these problems make great demands ; ; and by their demanding tend to create resources of men ' s minds and hearts which problems with easy answers do not bring forth . Of this , examples are legion : Pericles speaking his funeral oration in Ancient Greece ' s extremity after Thermopylae and making it a testament of freedom ; ; Jefferson writing the Declaration of Independence amid the catastrophes of revolution ; ; Christ preaching the Sermon on the Mount , close to his ultimate sacrifice ; ; Shakespeare speaking with `` the indescribable gusto of the Elizabethan voice '' -- ; ; Keats ' s words -- in the days of the Spanish Armada ' s threats ; ; Isaac Newton , at the age of twenty-three , industriously calculating logarithms `` to two and fifty places '' during the great plague year in England , 1665 ; ; Winston Churchill ' s Olympian , optimistic and resolute sayings when Britain stood alone against the armed forces of tyranny less than twenty years ago ; ; the present-day explorations of outer space , answering age-old questions of science and philosophy , in the face of possible wars of extinction .	Forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit , as the Roman poet , Virgil , declared with much more historical sense than most writers of today . It gives , indeed , cause for rejoicing to remember what many catastrophes of the past produced ; ; and it is to be noted also that confidence should grow from remembering that great men often appeared in the past to turn local catastrophe into future good for all mankind .	For example , out of the social evils of the English industrial revolution came the novels of Charles Dickens ; ; and his genius moved his readers to seek solutions of those evils for all Western men -- until today -- , in the industrialized West , these social evils substantially do not exist . The solutions were not arrived at by any theoreticians of the Karl Marx stripe but by men of government -- lawyers , most of them -- and men of business . These were educated men , who , as Mr . Justice Holmes was fond of saying , formed their inductions out of experience under the burden of responsibility . That is , to put it realistically , they had to run their businesses at a profit , or they had to get the votes to get elected . Nevertheless , they made naught of Marx ' s prophecy that capitalism would never pay the `` workers '' -- to use Marx ' s word -- more than a subsistence wage , with the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its way into the capitalists ' pockets with the result , in turn , that the gap between the rich and the poor would irrevocably widen and the misery of the poor increase .	But as all understand who have eyes to see , nothing of the kind has happened ; ; indeed , the contrary has happened . The gulf between the `` rich '' and the `` poor '' has narrowed , in the industrialized Western world , to the point that the word `` poor '' is hardly applicable . And the reason this could happen is clear : men of government , business men , lawyers and all who concerned themselves with the welfare of their fellow men did not let their concern to run their businesses at a profit restrict the development of freedom and opportunity . Some would say that they were not permitted to run their businesses only for profit ; ; and even putting it that way would not prove that Marx was anything but wrong .	Sir Henry Sumner Maine , a hundred years before Communism was a force to be reckoned with , wrote his brilliant legal generalization , that `` the progress of society is from status to contract '' . The essence of contract is that one is free to make a choice of what one will or will not do . Hence , the condition of freedom is a necessary condition for choice . The greater the range of freedom for individual men , the greater the range of choice ; ; the greater the range of choice , the greater the rate of change . For change is dependent on the possibilities that individual men glimpse for the future . But when there is not freedom and opportunity to choose , men -- individual men -- must remain in status and society does not , cannot , progress .	The eternal truth is that progress -- due , as it always is , to individual creative genius -- is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the beating of the heart .	And lest anybody think that considerations such as these are not germane in a foundation report , let me enlighten them with the truths that , under Communism there would have been no capital with which to endow the Foundation , and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the Fellows might proceed , untrammeled in every way , toward their discoveries , their creative efforts for the good of mankind .During the year 1959 , we granted 354 Fellowships ; ; in 1960 , we granted 334 . As heretofore , our Fellowships are available to assist research in all fields of knowledge and creative effort in all the arts . We do not favor one field over another : we think that all inquiry , all scholarly and artistic creation , is good -- provided only that it contributes to a sense and understanding of the true ends of life , as all first-rate scholarship and artistic creation does . Indeed , if pressed , we would say what the late Robert Henri , American painter , said to a pupil , `` Anything will do for a subject : it ' s what you do with it that counts '' .	Thus , we have no part , and want none , in current discussions of the relative importance of science , the social studies , the humanities , the creative arts . We want no part in such discussions , because we think them largely futile ; ; and we think them largely futile because , for true excellence of accomplishment , every scholar and every artist must cross boundaries of knowledge and boundaries of points of view .
	When the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company reached its 125th year as a going industrial concern during 1958 , it became an almost unique institution in the mechanical world .	With its history standing astride all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution , Brown & Sharpe has become over the years a singular monument to the mechanical foresight of its founder , Joseph R . Brown , and a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology .	Joseph R . Brown grew up in the bustle and enterprise of New England between 1810 and 1830 . He was early exposed to the mechanical world , and in his youth often helped his father , David Brown , master clock and watchmaker , as he plied his trade . At the age of 17 he became an apprentice machinist at the shop of Walcott & Harris in Valley Falls , Rhode Island , and following two or three other jobs in quick succession after graduation , he went into business for himself in 1831 , making lathes and small tools . This enterprise led to a father-and-son combination beginning in 1833 , under the name D . Brown & Son , a business which eventually grew into the modern corporation we now call Brown & Sharpe .	The years of Joseph ' s partnership with his father were numbered . In 1838 , a devastating fire gutted their small shop and soon thereafter David Brown moved west to Illinois , settling on a land grant in his declining years .	Joseph Brown continued in business by himself , quickly rebuilding the establishment which had been lost in the fire and beginning those first steps which were to establish him as a pioneer in raising the standards of accuracy of machine shop practice throughout the world .	Much of his genius , of course , sprang from his familiarity with clock movements . During these early years the repair of watches and clocks and the building of special clocks for church steeples formed an important part of the young man ' s occupation . He became particularly interested in graduating and precision measurement during the 1840 ' s , and his thinking along these lines developed considerably during this period . But his business also grew , and we are told that Mr . Brown found it increasingly difficult to devote as much time to his creative thinking as his inclinations led him to desire . It must have been with some pleasure and relief that on September 12 , 1848 , Joseph Brown made the momentous entry in his job book , in his characteristically cryptic style , `` Lucian Sharpe came to work for me this day as an apprentice '' .	The young apprentice apparently did well by Mr . Brown , for in the third year of his apprenticeship Lucian was offered a full partnership in the firm ; ; the company became `` J . R . Brown & Sharpe '' , and entered into a new and important period of its development . Mr . Sharpe ' s arrival in the business did indeed provide what Mr . Brown had most coveted -- time for `` tinkering '' , and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room those developments in precision graduation which most interested him at that time .	By 1853 , the new partnership announced the precision vernier caliper as the first fruit of their joint efforts . The basic significance of this invention helped them to follow it rapidly in 1855 by the development of a unique precision gear cutting and dividing engine . That development , in turn , formed the foundation of still more significant expansions in later years -- in gear cutting , in circular graduating , in index drilling , and in many other fields where accuracy was a paramount requirement .	Throughout their careers , both Mr . Brown and Mr . Sharpe were interested in the problem of setting up standards of measurement for the mechanical trades . Several efforts were made in this direction , and though not all of them survive to this day , the Brown & Sharpe wire gage system was eventually adopted as the American standard and is still in common use today .	As one development followed another , the company ' s reputation for precision in the graduating field brought it broader and broader opportunities for expansion in precision manufacture . In 1858 , the partnership began manufacturing the Willcox & Gibbs sewing machine .	As the story goes , Mr . Gibbs , who originally came from the back counties of the Commonwealth of Virginia , saw an illustration in a magazine of the famous Howe sewing machine . Curious as to what made it work , he built a crude model of it in wood , and filed a piece of steel until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread , enabling the crude machine to take stitches . When he showed this model as his `` solution '' as to how the Howe sewing machine operated , he was told he was `` wrong '' , and discovered to his amazement that the Howe Machine , which was unknown to him in detail , used two threads while the one that he had perfected used only one . Thus was invented the single thread sewing machine , which Mr . Gibbs in partnership with Mr . Willcox decided to bring to Brown & Sharpe with the proposal that the small company undertake its manufacture .	The new work was a boon to the partnership , not only for its own value but particularly for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of J . R . Brown toward yet further developments for production equipment .	The turret screw machine , now known as the Brown & Sharpe hand screw machine , takes its ancestry directly from Mr . Brown ' s efforts to introduce equipment to simplify the manufacture of the sewing machine . Mr . Brown made important additions to the arts in screw machine design by drastically improving the means for revolving the turret , by introducing automatic feeding devices for the stock , and reversible tap and die holders .	In 1861 , Mr . Brown ' s attention was called to yet another basic production problem -- the manufacture of twist drills . At that time , during the Civil War , Union muskets were being manufactured in Providence and the drills to drill them were being hand-filed with rattail files . This process neither satisfied the urgent production schedules nor Mr . Brown ' s imagination of the possibilities in the situation . The child of this problem was Mr . Brown ' s famous Serial No . 1 Universal Milling Machine , the archtype from which is descended today ' s universal knee-type milling machine used throughout the world . The original machine , bearing its famous serial number , is still on exhibition at the Brown & Sharpe Precision Center in Providence .	During the Civil War period Mr . Brown also invented the Brown & Sharpe formed tooth gear cutter , a basic invention which ultimately revolutionized the world ' s gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic economics . Up until that time it had been possible to make cutters for making gear teeth , but they were good for only one sharpening . As soon as the time came for re-sharpening , the precise form of the gear tooth was lost and a new cutter had to be made . This process made the economical manufacture of gears questionable until some way could be found to permit the repeated re-sharpening of gear tooth cutters without the loss of the precision form . Mr . Brown ' s invention achieved this and , as a byproduct , formed the cornerstone of Brown & Sharpe ' s position of leadership in the gear making equipment field which lasted until the 1920 ' s when superceded by other methods .	The micrometer caliper , as a common workshop tool , also owes much to J . R . Brown . Although Mr . Brown was not himself its inventor ( it was a French idea ) , it is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance of mass producing this basic tool for general use . So it was that when Mr . Brown and Mr . Sharpe first saw the French tool on exhibition in Paris in 1868 , they brought a sample with them to the United States and started Brown & Sharpe in yet another field where it retains its leadership to this day .	The final achievement of Mr . Brown ' s long and interesting mechanical career runs a close second in importance to his development of the universal milling machine . That achievement was his creation of the universal grinding machine , which made its appearance in 1876 at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition . This machine , like its milling counterpart , was the antecedent of a machine-family used to this very day in precision metalworking shops throughout the world . Along with J . R . Brown ' s other major developments , the universal grinding machine was profoundly influential in setting the course of Brown & Sharpe for many years to come .	Following Mr . Brown ' s death , there came forward in the Brown & Sharpe organization many other men who contributed greatly to the development of the company . One such man was Samuel Darling .	As head of the firm Darling & Swartz , Mr . Darling began by challenging Brown & Sharpe to its keenest competition during the 1850 ' s and early 60 ' s . In 1868 , however , a truce was called between the companies , and the partnership of Darling , Brown & Sharpe was formed . Between that year and the buying out of Mr . Darling ' s interest in 1892 , a large portion of the company ' s precision tool business was carried out under the name of Darling , Brown & Sharpe , and to this day many old precision tools are in use still bearing that famous trademark .	Perhaps the outstanding standard bearer of Mr . Brown ' s tradition for accuracy was Mr . Oscar J . Beale , whose mechanical genius closely paralleled that of Mr . Brown , and whose particular forte was the development of the exceedingly accurate measuring machinery that enabled Brown & Sharpe to manufacture gages , and therefore its products , with an accuracy exceeding anything then available elsewhere in the world .	Also important on the Brown & Sharpe scene , at the turn of the century , was Mr . Richmond Viall , Works Superintendent of the company from 1876 to 1910 . Mr . Viall possessed remarkable talents for the leadership and development of men . He was an ardent champion of the Brown & Sharpe Apprentice Program and personal counselor to countless able men who first developed their industrial talents with the company . In one sense it can be said that one of the most important Brown & Sharpe products over the years has been the men who began work with the company and subsequently came to places of industrial eminence throughout the nation and even abroad .	Commencing with the death of Lucian Sharpe in 1899 , the name of Henry D . Sharpe was for more than 50 years closely interwoven with the destiny of the company . During his presidency , the company ' s physical plant was enormously expanded , and the length and breadth of the Brown & Sharpe machine tool line became the greatest in the world . During the early part of this century , the Brown & Sharpe works in Providence were unchallenged as the largest single manufacturing facility devoted exclusively to precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world .	During these years the company ' s product line followed the basic tenets laid down by Mr . Brown . It expanded from hand screw machines to automatic screw machines , from simple formed-tooth gear cutting machines to gear hobbing machines and a large contract gear manufacturing business , from rudimentary belt-driven universal milling machines to a broad line of elaborately controlled knee-type and manufacturing type milling machines . In the grinding machine field , expansion went far from universal grinders alone and took in cylindrical grinders , surface grinders , and a wide variety of special and semi-special models .	In 1951 , Henry D . Sharpe , Jr . succeeded his father and continued the company ' s development as a major factor in the metal-working equipment business . The company is still broadening its line and is now active on four major fronts .	The Machine Tool Division is currently producing Brown & Sharpe single spindle automatic screw machines , grinding machines of many types , and knee and bed-type milling machines . Recently added is the Brown & Sharpe turret drilling machine which introduces the company to an entirely new field of tool development .	In the Industrial Products Division , the company manufactures and markets a wide line of precision gaging and inspection equipment , machinists ' tools -- including micrometers , Vernier calipers , and accessories .	In the Cutting Tool Division , the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling cutters , end mills and saws .
Sales and net income for the year ended December 31 , 1960 showed an improvement over 1959 . Net income was $2 , 557 , 111 , or $3 . 11 per share on 821 , 220 common shares currently outstanding , as compared to $2 , 323 , 867 or $2 . 82 per share in 1959 , adjusted to the same number of shares .	Sales and other operating income increased 25 . 1% from $24 , 926 , 615 in 1959 to $31 , 179 , 816 in 1960 . This increase was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development .	In spite of the fact that our largest market , the textile industry , was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity , we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 at a rate materially higher than during 1959 .Outlook for current year Our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and unless this trend can be reversed , our production for 1961 will be lower than for 1960 .	However , the healthy inventory position of the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961 .Need for sound tax policy In connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient mill machinery , a sounder U . S . income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment , enabling the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis , could , if adopted , have favorable effects on Leesona ' s business in the next few years .	Such a depreciation policy would also , we believe , prove a very important factor in strengthening the competitive position of the U . S . textile and other industries , thus helping to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange .Research and development Our research and development program , serving as it does an industry which must compete against low-cost production throughout the world , continues to have primary emphasis at Leesona .	This program is based on the policy of designing and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile values -- fabrics whose cost in relation to quality , fashion and utility provide the consumer with better textile products for the money .	Such policy involves continuing effort to improve on existing mill equipment , in terms of efficiency and versatility . But more important , we believe , it must concentrate on the development of entirely new concepts in textile processing as do the Unifil loom winder and our more recent Uniconer automatic coning machine .Budget increased On this basis , our already substantial budget for research and development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance the continuing engineering and design work essential to Leesona ' s future growth in sales and earnings .	Much of this necessary increase in research and development , though properly chargeable to current expenses , is not reflected in earnings until projects are completed and the new machines sold in quantity , usually over a period of several years .Stretch yarn machines In December we began to ship our ultra-high-speed stretch yarn machines . These machines produce the higher quality stretch yarns required in weaving stretch and textured fabrics . During the past year , great progress has been made by the weaving mills in creating new stretch and textured fabrics . Fashion centers are now predicting broad acceptance of sports apparel and improved `` wash and wear '' dresses and blouses made from these fabrics .	This machine , operating at speeds up to 350 , 000 revolutions per minute , is believed to provide one of the fastest mechanical operations in industry today . It transfers yarn directly from the producers ' largest package into ideal supply packages for use on Unifil loom winders in weaving stretch yarn fabrics .Large-package twister Our new large-package ring twister for glass fiber yarns is performing well in our customers ' mills . Later in the year , additional types of this Leesona twister will be made available to mills for other man-made fibers and natural yarns . These machines are designed to provide higher operating speeds , larger yarn packages , and greater flexibility of application to different types of yarn . This we believe will substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment .Uniconer Major activity at Providence in 1961 will involve the scheduled completion of tooling for production of the Uniconer automatic coning machine . This work is progressing on schedule and we expect to make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year . This machine was demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last year and was well received by the industry . The potential market for the machine should be comparable to that of the Unifil loom winder .	The Uniconer has several outstanding features -- it operates with much greater efficiency than existing equipment ; ; it incorporates an automatic knot-tying device on each spindle , and it will knot a break in the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new bobbins as the running end is exhausted .	Because the bobbin-to-cone winding process is a relatively high-cost operation for the mill , the almost complete automation provided by the Uniconer can mean important economies in textile production , at the same time upgrading quality . Many mills have already placed firm orders for this machine .New Unifil application A new application for the Unifil loom winder , running single filling for box looms , will broaden mill use of this equipment .Take-up machines A new spinning take-up machine has been developed to facilitate the use of our take-up machine in the production of thermoplastic yarns . It is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to hold precise tension and speed .	This new machine takes up filament yarn from spinneret or extruder and winds large packages at speeds up to 6 , 000 feet per minute . It is equipped with an automatic threading device to reduce waste and handling time .	Our take-up machines and our twister-coners are undergoing important pilot plant testing for application with new high polymer yarns , in several fiber producing plants . We look forward to a stronger position in this expanding field .Diversification plans We are interested in further diversification into other fields of capital goods , or components for industrial products , and have recently intensified our efforts in that direction .Patterson Moos research Our Patterson Moos Research Division has made further very encouraging progress in development of fuel cells . The cooperation of our exclusive American licensee , Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division of United Aircraft Corporation , has been important in this work . In addition to its major effort on fuel cells , Patterson Moos Research Division is continuing to carry on research in other fields , both under contract for the Defense Department , other government agencies and for our own account . PMR is currently supplying components vital to the Titan and Minuteman programs .	We have recently entered into an agreement with Compagnie Generale De Telegraphie Sans Fil ( CSF ) of France for the exclusive exchange of technical information on thermoelectric materials . The agreement gives us rights for manufacturing and marketing of such materials in the United States . Initially we will import the thermoelectric materials and modules from France but later we will manufacture in this country . There is a rapidly growing demand for this material , primarily from the military . Further research , we believe , will develop important commercial applications .	A project for the Air Force has been completed in which the NAIR infrared detecting device was developed for area monitoring of noxious or dangerous gases .	We are initiating research on the use of solid state materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity .	The rapid advance in science today suggests many other avenues of investigation . Our plan is to keep abreast of these advances , and select for development those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities .New plant facilities Early in August we broke ground for a new $3 , 500 , 000 plant in Warwick , Rhode Island , which will house our textile and coil winding machinery operations . Construction is well along , and the plant is scheduled for completion in November of this year . All operations now carried on at our plant at Cranston will be transferred to Warwick . Operations in the new plant should be producing efficiently early in 1962 .	An architect ' s sketch of the new plant is shown on the front cover . The building will contain 430 , 000 square feet , approximately the same as our present plant . However , its modern one-story layout is designed to increase our production capacity , permit more efficient manufacturing , and substantially reduce current repair and maintenance costs .	A major consideration in the choice of the Warwick site , four miles from Cranston , was the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly skilled work force .	We have entered into an agreement for the sale of the present Cranston properties , effective as soon as we have completed removal to our new plant .British subsidiary During the year our British subsidiary , Leesona-Holt , Limited , expanded its plant in Darwen , England , and added machine tool capacity . The operations of its other plant in Rochdale and Leesona ' s former operations in Manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant in the adjoining town of Heywood . Layout and equipment were modernized and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis . The area available at Heywood is approximately three times the size of the former Rochdale and Manchester locations . In addition , land has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future .Financial developments The new Warwick plant is being built at our expense and under our direction . It will be transfered on completion to The Industrial Foundation of Rhode Island , a non-profit organization , which will reimburse us for the cost of construction . We will then occupy the new plant under lease , with an option to purchase . These arrangements are , in our opinion , very favorable to Leesona . Interim financing of construction costs is provided by a short term loan from The Chase Manhattan Bank .	In addition to expenditures on the Warwick plant , we have invested approximately $1 , 961 , 000 for machinery and equipment at Cranston , and for new machinery , plant and equipment at Leesona-Holt , Limited . We believe that these improved facilities will contribute income and effect savings which will fully justify the investment .	Long term loans have been reduced by $395 , 000 to $2 , 461 , 000 . Inventories increased $625 , 561 to $8 , 313 , 514 during the year and should decline in coming months . Thus we enter 1961 in a strong financial position .Employee contracts In accordance with the two-year contract signed in May , 1959 , with the International Association of Machinists , AFL-CIO , wages of hourly employees were increased by 4% in May , 1960 , and pay levels for non-exempt salaried employees were increased proportionately . In addition , Blue Cross coverage for all employees and their dependents was extended to provide the full cost of semi-private hospital accommodations .Personnel benefits In addition to direct salaries and wages , the Company paid or accrued during the year the following amounts for the benefit of employees : 	During the pension year ended December 31 , 1960 , 23 employees retired , making a total of 171 currently retired under the Company ' s pension plan . At December 13 , 1960 the fund held by the Industrial National Bank of Providence , as trustee for payment of past and future service pensions to qualified members of the plan , totaled $2 , 412 , 616 .	The basic market for textiles is growing with the expansion of the population that began 20 years ago . Another growth factor is increased consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics that go with a rising standard of living .	As in many other industries , rising costs and intense competition , both domestic and foreign , have exerted increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry in recent years .Increased efficiency In textiles , as elsewhere , a major part of the solution lies in greater efficiency and higher productivity .	As a designer and manufacturer of textile production machinery , Leesona and other companies in its industry have sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods that would increase production , yet maintain both quality and flexibility .Problems of shifting styles The problem of efficient production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in apparel or home decoration . Production must be adjusted accordingly , at minimum cost and quickly .	In addition , production machinery must in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural fibers and the increasing number of synthetics , as well as blends .
Following the term of service in Japan , each emissary returns for a brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college community . The Carleton Service Fund provides the financial support for this program .Musical activities the college was one of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite part of the curriculum but as a vital adjunct to campus life . Extensive facilities for group performance are provided by maintaining , under skilled direction , the Choir , the Orchestra , the Band , the Glee Club , and smaller ensembles of wind and string players .	All students are invited to participate in any of the musical organizations for which they qualify . Orchestra , Band , and Choir have auditions during the week preceding the first day of classes . The Glee Club is open to all students and faculty with no auditions necessary for membership .	In addition to the many appearances of these organizations throughout the college year , there are concerts by students of the music department , by members of the music faculty , and by visiting artists .	Student musical organizations are the Knights of Carleton and the Overtones ( men ' s vocal groups ) , and the Keynotes ( a women ' s singing group ) . These student-directed organizations include eight to ten members each ; ; they perform at many campus social events .Religious activities from the founding of the College those responsible for its management have planned to provide its students favorable conditions for personal religious development and to offer opportunities through the curriculum and otherwise for understanding the meaning and importance of religion . Courses are offered in ethics , the philosophy and history of religion , Christian thought and history , and the Bible . Carleton aims throughout its entire teaching program to represent a point of view and a spirit which will contribute to the moral and religious development of its students .	A college service of worship is held each Sunday morning at eleven o ' clock in the Chapel . The sermons are given by the College Chaplain , by members of the faculty , or by guest preachers . Music is furnished by the Carleton College Choir .	Chapel services are held weekly . These services at which attendance is voluntary are led by the Chaplain , by the President of the College , by selected faculty members , students , and visitors . The service is brief and variety in forms of worship is practiced .	A Sunday evening program provides theological lectures , music , drama , and films related to the issues of the Judeo-Christian tradition .	Attendance is required at the College Service of Worship or at the Sunday Evening Program or at any regularly organized service of public worship . Each semester every student must attend ten of the services or religious meetings . Attendance at the Chapel Service is voluntary .	Religious organizations include the groups described below . The Y . M . C . A . and Y . W . C . A . at Carleton are connected with the corresponding national organizations and carry out their general purposes . Occasional meetings are held for the whole membership , usually with a guest speaker , while smaller discussion groups meet more frequently . The Associations sponsor many traditional campus events and provide students with opportunities to form new friendships , to broaden their interests , and to engage in worthwhile service projects .	There are other organizations representing several of the denominational groups . Included are the following : Baptist Student Movement , Canterbury Club ( Episcopal ) , Christian Science Organization , Friends ' Meeting for Worship , Hillel ( Jewish ) , Liberal Religious Fellowship , Lutheran Student Association , Newman Club ( Roman Catholic ) , Presbyterian Student Fellowship , United Student Fellowship ( Congregational-Baptist ) , and Wesley Fellowship ( Methodist ) .	Student religious organizations are co-ordinated under the Religious Activities Committee , a standing committee of the Carleton Student Association .	The Northfield churches include the following : Alliance , Congregational-Baptist , Episcopal , Lutheran ( Norwegian , Danish , Missouri Synod , and Bethel ) , Methodist , Moravian , Pentecostal , and Roman Catholic .Theater the purpose of producing plays at the College is three-fold : to provide the Carleton students with the best possible opportunity for theater-going within the limits set by the maturity and experience of the performers and the theatrical facilities available ; ; to encourage the practice of attending the theater ; ; and to develop a discriminating audience for good drama and sensitive performance .	Dramatic activity at the College is organized and carried on by The Carleton Players , which is to say by all students who are so inclined to advance these aims .	For the 1960-1961 season , The Carleton Players have announced Blood Wedding by Federico Garcia Lorca , The Knight Of The Burning Pestle by Beaumont and Fletcher and A Moon For The Misbegotten by Eugene O ' Neill , with a pre-season production of The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams .Student workshop this workshop , located in Boliou Hall , provides facilities for students to work in ceramics , weaving , enameling , welding , woodworking , textile printing , printmaking , and lapidary . These extra-curricular activities are conducted under supervision of the Director of the Student Workshop . The workshop is open five afternoons and two evenings each week .	A student organization , Bottega , is open to any student interested in increasing his understanding and appreciation of the graphic and ceramic arts in their historical , technical , and productive contexts . The group meets once a week in the Boliou Student Workshop . They are assisted and advised by members of the Art Department .Athletics the Athletic program at Carleton is considered an integral part of the activities of the College and operates under the same budgetary procedure and controls as the academic work .	The physical education program for men recognizes the value of participation in competitive sports in the development of the individual student and aims to give every man an opportunity to enter some form of athletic competition , either intercollegiate or intramural .	The same standards for admission , for eligibility to receive scholarships or grants-in-aid , and for scholastic performance at college apply to all students .	A faculty committee on athletics , responsible to the faculty as a whole , exercises control over the athletic program of the College . It concerns itself with : 1 .The policies which govern the program 2 .The preservation of desirable balance between the athletic and academic programs of the College 3 .The approval of athletic schedules 4 .The maintenance of Midwest Conference eligibility standards 	Carleton is a member of the Midwest Collegiate Athletic Conference and abides by its eligibility rules . In addition to these rules , Carleton has added the following : 1 .A student who while in attendance at Carleton College participates in an athletic contest during the school year , other than that sponsored by the College , shall be permanently ineligible to participate in intercollegiate athletics at Carleton College and will also face permanent suspension from the institution . The school year does not end for any student until he has completed his last examination of the semester . 2 .A student to be eligible for the captaincy of any Carleton team must have a scholastic record of at least 1 . 00 .	The `` C '' club is composed of the men of the College who have won an official letter in Carleton athletics . The purpose of the Club is to promote better athletic teams at Carleton and to increase interest in them among the student body . This is done by encouraging the entire male student body to participate in either the intercollegiate or intramural sports program and by sponsoring the Carleton cheerleaders . Soccer Club .The Soccer Club was organized by undergraduate men interested in playing soccer and promoting the sport . Membership consists of both beginners and experienced players . Practices are held regularly and the schedule of games is prepared by the student coach and the officers of the club . Women ' s Recreation Association .This Association , organized in 1920 , is affiliated with the Athletic Federation of College Women . The purpose of the organization is to further the interest of women students in recreational activities as a means of promoting physical efficiency , sportsmanship , and `` play for play ' s sake '' . The Association is governed by a board made up of representatives from each of the four classes . Membership is open to any woman student in the College . Active groups sponsored by the organization include the Saddle Club , Orchesis , Golf Club , Tennis Club , and Dolphins . The Saddle Club , open to students proficient in horsemanship , presents the Annual Spring Riding Exhibition , and during the year it offers speakers , movies , breakfast rides , and trips to broaden their knowledge of the sport . Orchesis , for students interested in the modern dance , contributes to the May Fete and offers earlier in the year a modern dance demonstration . Tennis Club participates in a dual tennis tournament with the University of Minnesota each fall , and also sponsors a two-day state invitational tennis meet at Carleton in May . The Dolphins present a three-night water show the week of the May Fete . Under the auspices of the Women ' s Recreation Association , interclass competition is organized in badminton , basketball , field hockey , golf , tennis , and swimming . The Association participates in the winter sports carnival and sponsors several Play Days with St . Olaf and other nearby colleges . With the co-operation of the Department of Physical Education for Men , the Women ' s Recreation Association arranges mixed tournaments in tennis and golf in the fall and spring . Throughout the year there are social events , such as picnics , breakfast hikes , canoe trips , banquets , and indoor parties .College publications in addition to the miscellaneous pamphlets and other printed matter which it issues , the College maintains regular publications , as follows : 	The Bulletin , in five issues : The Report Of The President in August ; ; The Alumni Fund Report in September ; ; the Annual Catalog in March ; ; an Alumni Reunion Bulletin in April ; ; and a special Bulletin in June . The College also publishes each year The Report Of The Treasurer and a monthly newsletter entitled Carleton College Comments . In co-operation with the Alumni Association of Carleton College , an alumni magazine , The Voice Of The Carleton Alumni , is edited and mailed seven times a year by the College ' s Publications Office and the Alumni Office . At intervals an alumni directory is issued .	These publications may be secured as follows : The Annual Catalog from the Director of Admissions and other issues from the Publications Office .	In January , 1960 , the first issue of The Carleton Miscellany , a quarterly literary magazine , was published by the College . The magazine , edited by members of the Carleton Department of English , includes contributions by authors from both within and beyond the Carleton community .Student publications The Carletonian , the college newspaper , is edited by students and published by the College under the supervision of the Publications Board .( See page 100 .) It is issued weekly throughout the college year . The Publications Board holds annual competitive examinations for places on the editorial and business staffs . The editor , sports editor , and student business manager are chosen in December , the new staff assuming responsibility for the paper at the beginning of the second semester . The paper affords excellent practice for students interested in the field of journalism .	The Algol , the college annual , is published in the fall of each year . The Algol serves as a record of campus organizations and student activities during the year . The Publications Board receives applications for the positions of editor and business manager and makes the appointments in the spring previous to the year of publication . Members of The Algol staff are nominated by the editor and business manager and appointed by the Publications Board .	Manuscript , a quarterly literary magazine , is published by the students of the College . It is the purpose of this magazine to serve as an outlet for student creative writing . The editor and business manager of Manuscript are appointed by the Publications Board .Campus broadcasting station A low-power , `` carrier-current '' broadcasting station , KARL , heard only in the campus dormitories , is owned and operated by the students to provide an outlet for student dramatic , musical , literary , technical , and other talents , and to furnish information , music , and entertainment for campus listeners . Over a hundred students participate in the planning and production of the daily program schedule . KARL provides experience for students who wish to pursue careers in radio .Student government the Carleton Student Association includes all students in college and is intended `` to work for the betterment of Carleton College by providing student government and student participation with the college administration in the formulation and execution of policies which pertain to student life and activities '' .	The Carleton Social Co-operative is a standing committee of the Carleton Student Association . Week-end activities for the entire campus are planned by the Co-op Board .
	In recent months , much attention has been given to the probable extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat divided as to the outlook for the near future . And yet , despite some disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new decade , 1960 has been a good year in many ways , with many overall measures of business having reached new peaks for the year as a whole . The shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing , in that it has prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized many previous swings in the business cycle . This caution has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier , and the fact stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level .	In the electronics industry , this tendency is well illustrated by inventories of TV sets . Factory stocks in recent months have been the highest they have been in three years , while those at retail are below 1959 . The total value of our industry ' s shipments , at factory prices , increased from $9 . 2 billion in 1959 to approximately $10 . 1 billion as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business -- home entertainment , military , industrial , and replacement . I believe a further gain is in prospect for 1961 .Home entertainment sales up Reflecting the largest percentage of high-end sets such as consoles and combinations since 1953 , dollar value of home entertainment electronics in 1960 was about $1 . 9 billion , compared to $1 . 7 billion in 1959 . Sales of TV sets at retail ran ahead of the like months of 1959 through July ; ; set production ( excluding those destined for the export market ) also ran ahead in the early months , but was curtailed after the usual vacation shutdowns in the face of growing evidence that some of the early production plans had been overly optimistic . For the year as a whole , retail sales of TV sets probably came to 5 . 8 million against 5 . 7 million in 1959 ; ; however , production came to only 5 . 6 million compared to 6 . 2 million .	In contrast to the lower turnout of TV , total radio production increased from 15 . 4 million sets to 16 . 7 million ( excluding export ) . Both home and auto radios were in excellent demand , with retail sales of home sets ahead of 1959 in every month of the first eleven ; ; sales and production of home sets were about equal at 10 . 4 million units . Auto set production came to about 6 . 3 million compared to 5 . 6 million in 1959 . Separate phonographs also had a good year , reflecting the growing popularity of stereo sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade that characterized the radio-TV market .	The outlook for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present , but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers to step up their buying plans for durable goods . I would expect that sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some 10 - 15% but that second-half levels should show a favorable comparison , with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business conditions recover as some recent forecasts suggest they will . I look for TV sales and production to be approximately equal at 5 . 7 million sets for the year , but I look for some decline in radios from the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of 15 . 0 - 15 . 5 million sets . I therefore believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about $1 . 8 million , slightly below 1960 , but above 1959 .Military electronics to grow 1960 witnessed another substantial increase in our industry ' s shipments of military electronics , which totalled about $5 . 4 billion compared to $4 . 9 billion in 1959 . It is interesting to note that the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than the industry ' s total sales to all markets in 1950-1953 , which were good years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period of rapid consumer acceptance . It has been correctly pointed out by well-informed people in the industry that it is probably unrealistic to expect a continuation of the yearly growth of 15% or better that characterized the decade of the 1950 ' s , and that our military markets may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons systems will give way to concentration of still undeveloped areas of our defense capability . While this may well be true in general , I believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding rapidly in other directions .	Among the items scheduled for acceleration in the near future are the Polaris and B70 programs , strengthening of the airborne alert system of the Strategic Air Command , and improved battlefield surveillance systems . Research and development expenditures connected with the reconnaissance satellite SAMOS and the future development of ballistic missile defense systems such as Nike-Zeus are expected to increase substantially . Research , development test and evaluation funds , devoted to missiles in 1960 were 3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft , and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed aircraft procurement by 1963 . Still later , the realm of space technology will show substantial gains ; ; it has been estimated that spending by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will rise from less than $500 million in fiscal 1960 to more than $2 billion by 1967 , and that the electronic industry ' s share of these expenditures will be closer to 50% than the current 20% .	The stepped-up defense procurement called for in the 1961 Budget has already begun to make itself felt in an upturn in orders for military electronic equipment and the components that go into it , and it has been suggested that an additional $2 billion increase in total defense spending may be requested for fiscal 1962 . Although the impact of these increases on our industry ' s shipments will be gradual , on balance I look for another good increase in shipments in the coming year , to at least $6 billion .Industrial electronic equipment Paced by the continuing rapid growth of electronic data processing , sales of industrial and commercial electronic equipment totalled $1 . 8 billion compared to $1 . 6 billion in 1959 . The market for computers and other data-handling continues to expand at the rate of about 30% annually , reaching some $450 million in 1960 . Informed estimates look for this market to approximately quadruple by the late 1960 ' s , under the stimulus of new applications in the fields of banking and retailing , industrial process control , and information storage and retrieval . In the industrial field , prospects for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment are also quite bright . For the near term , however , it must be realized that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive to general business conditions than is the military market , and for this reason I would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller than those of recent years ; ; sales should slightly exceed 1960 , however , and reach $1 . 9 billion .Replacement parts In addition to the three major original equipment segments of the electronics business , the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues year by year . This is now a $1 . 0 billion business , up from $0 . 9 billion in 1959 , and should reach $1 . 1 billion in 1961 .	The markets for electronic parts in 1960 have reflected the changing patterns of the various end equipment segments of the industry . Demand for parts for home entertainment was strong in the first half , but purchases were cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced their own operating rates . In the military field , incoming orders turned down early in the year , and remained rather slow until late fall when the upturn in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt in rising orders for components .	Sales of transistors in 1960 exceeded $300 million , compared to $222 million in 1959 despite substantial price reductions in virtually all types . Production totalled about 123 million units against 82 million in 1959 , and I look for a further gain to 188 million units worth approximately $380 million in 1961 . Sales of passive components , such as capacitors and resistors , although not growing as fast as those of semi-conductors were ahead of 1959 this year , and should increase again in 1961 .	In sum , I look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 , with total sales increasing about 7% to $10 . 8 billion , despite the uncertainties in the business outlook generally . As I have indicated above , I base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of the year , but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring the full-year figures close to those of 1960 ; ; on prospects for continued increases in defense spending ; ; and on continued growth in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the 1960 ' s .	The appointment of Gilbert B . Devey as General Manager of VecTrol Engineering , Inc . , of Stamford , Connecticut , a leading manufacturer of thyratron and silicon controlled rectifier electrical controls , has been announced by David B . Peck , Vice President , Special Products .	Mr . Devey will be responsible for the commercial expansion of VecTrol ' s line of electronic and electrical power control components as furnished to end equipment manufacturers , working closely with Walter J .

Scarborough , Manager of Interference Control Field Service . The appointment was made in a move to expand the engineering services offered to the designers of electronic systems through assistance in electro-magnetic compatability problems .
	She concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient .	The fish took the bait . He replied that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a stranger , but -- joy of joys , he would be at home at the hour mentioned .	But when she called he had thought better of the matter and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement . She was told by the manservant who opened the door that his lordship was engaged on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed . Claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff daunt her purpose . She wrote again and now , abandoning for the moment the theme of love , she asked for help in the matter of her career . She could act and she could write . His lordship was concerned in the management of Drury Lane but , if there were no opportunities there , would he read and criticize her novel ? ?	At last he consented to meet her , and following that brief interview Claire wrote him a yet more remarkable proposal : 	Have you any objection to the following plan ? ? On Thursday evening we may go out of town together by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles . There we shall be free and unknown ; ; we can return the following morning 	She concluded by asking for a brief interview -- `` to settle with you where '' -- and she threw in a tribute to his `` gentle manners '' and `` the wild originality of your countenance '' .	She opened his reply with trembling fingers he agreed ! ! And he would see her that evening . Victory at last ! !	At their meeting he told her not to bother about `` where '' -- he would attend to that . There was one of the new forte-pianos in the room and , as Claire rose to go , he asked her to sing him one song before she left . She sang him Scott ' s charming ballad `` Rosabelle '' , which was the vogue of the moment . She had never sung better .	`` Your voice is delightful '' , he approved with a warm smile .`` Tomorrow will be a new experience -- I have never before made love to a nightingale . There have been cooing doves , chattering magpies , thieving jackdaws , a proud peacock , a silly goose , and a harpy eagle -- whom I was silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my vitals '' .	And so they went , he choosing of all places an inn near Medmenham Abbey , scene a generation ago of the obscene orgies of the Hellfire Club . He regaled Claire with an account of the mock mass performed by the cassocked bloods , which he had had at firsthand from old Bud Dodington , one of the leaders of the so-called `` Order '' . Each wore the monkish scourge at his waist but this , it seems , was not employed for self-flagellation . Naked girls danced in the chancel of the Abbey , the youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen to read a sermon filled with veiled depravities .	The jaded amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish . Alas , all that belonged to the age of `` Devil Dashwood '' and `` Wicked Wilkes '' , abbot and beadsman of the Order ! ! The casual seduction of a seventeen-year-old bluestocking seemed tame by comparison .	They passed close by the turn to Bishopsgate . A scant half mile away Shelley and Mary were doubtless sitting on their diminutive terrace , the air about them scented with stock , and listening to the nightingale who had nested in the big lime tree at the foot of the garden . Charming and peaceful -- but what were charm and peace compared to high adventure ? ? Alone with the fabulous Byron ! ! How many women had longed for the privilege that was hers .	How was she to behave , Claire wondered . To be passive , to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd . She was the pursuer as clearly as was Venus in Shakespeare ' s poem . And while her Adonis did not suffer from inexperience , satiety might well be an equal handicap . No , she would not pretend modesty , but neither must she be crudely bold . Mystery -- that was the thing . In the bedroom she would insist on darkness . With his club foot he might well be grateful .	At the inn , which was situated close to a broad weir , Byron was greeted by the landlord with obsequious deference and addressed as `` milord '' . The place was evidently a familiar haunt and Claire wondered what other illicit loves had been celebrated in the comfortable rooms to which they were shown .	The fire in the sitting room was lighted .	`` What about the bedroom '' ? ? Byron inquired .`` Seems to me last time I was here the grate bellowed out smoke as it might have been preparing us for hell '' .	`` We found some owls had built a nest in the chimney , milord , but I promise you you ' ll never have trouble of that sort again '' .	So , not only had he been here before , but it seemed he might well come again . Claire felt suddenly small and cheap , heroine of a trivial episode in the voluminous history of Don Juan .	A cold supper was ordered and a bottle of port . When Napoleon ' s ship had borne him to Elba , French wines had started to cross the Channel , the first shipments in a dozen war-ridden years , but the supplies had not yet reached rural hostelries where the sweet wines of the Spanish peninsula still ruled .	As they waited for supper they sat by the fire , glasses in hand , while Byron philosophized as much for his own entertainment as hers .	`` Sex is overpriced '' , he said .`` The great Greek tragedies are concerned with man against Fate , not man against man for the prize of a woman ' s body . So don ' t see yourself as a heroine or fancy this little adventure is an event of major importance '' .	`` The gods seemed to think sex pretty important '' , she rebutted .`` Mars and Venus , Bacchus and Ariadne , Jupiter and Io , Byron and the nymph of the owl ' s nest . That would be Minerva , I suppose . Wasn ' t the owl her symbol '' ? ?	Byron laughed .`` So you know something of the classics , do you '' ? ?	`` Tell me about Minerva , how she behaved , what she did to please you '' .	`` I ' ll tell you nothing . I don ' t ask you who ' tis you ' re being unfaithful to , husband or lover . Frankly , I don ' t care '' .	For a moment she thought of answering with the truth but she knew there were men who shied away from virginity , who demanded some degree of education in body as well as mind .	`` Very well '' , she said , `` I ' ll not catechize you . What matter the others so long as I have my place in history '' .	She was striking the right note . No man ever had a better opinion of himself and indeed , with one so favored , flattery could hardly seem overdone . Brains and beauty , high position in both the social and intellectual worlds , athlete , fabled lover -- if ever the world was any man ' s oyster it was his .	The light supper over , Claire went to him and , slipping an arm about his shoulder , sat on his knee . He drew her close and , hand on cheek , turned her face to his . Her lips , moist and parted , spoke his name .	`` Byron '' ! !	His hand went to her shoulder and pushed aside the knotted scarf that surmounted the striped poplin gown ; ; then , to better purpose , he took hold of the knot and with dextrous fingers , untied it . The bodice beneath was buttoned and , withdrawing his lips from hers , he set her upright on his knee and started to undo it , unhurriedly as if she were a child .	But , kindled by his kiss , his caressing hand , her desire was aflame . She sprang up and went swiftly to the bedroom . Lord Byron poured himself another glass of wine and held it up to the candle flame admiring the rich color . He drank slowly with due appreciation . It was an excellent vintage .	He rose and went to the bedroom . Pausing in the doorway he said : `` The form of the human female , unlike her mind and her spirit , is the most challenging loveliness in all nature '' .When Claire returned to Bishopsgate she longed to tell them she had become Byron ' s mistress . By odd coincidence , on the evening of her return Shelley chose to read Parisina , which was the latest of the titled poet ' s successes . As he declaimed the sonorous measures , it was as much as Claire could do to restrain herself from bursting out with her dramatic tidings .	`` Although it is not the best of which he is capable '' , said Shelley as he closed the book , `` it is still poetry of a high order '' .	`` If he would only leave the East '' , said Mary .`` I am tired of sultans and scimitars '' .	`` The hero of his next poem is Napoleon Bonaparte '' , said Claire , with slightly overdone carelessness .	`` How do you know that '' ? ? Demanded Mary .	`` I was told it on good authority '' , Claire answered darkly .`` I mustn ' t tell , I mustn ' t tell '' , she repeated to herself .`` I promised him I wouldn ' t '' .Chapter 9 winter came , and with it Mary ' s baby -- a boy as she had wished . William , he was called , in honor of the man who was at once Shelley ' s pensioner and his most bitter detractor . With a pardonable irony Shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his daughter : 	`` Fanny and Mrs . Godwin will probably be glad to hear that Mary has safely recovered from a very favorable confinement , and that her child is well '' .	At the same time another child -- this one of Shelley ' s brain -- was given to the world : Alastor , a poem of pervading beauty in which the reader may gaze into the still depths of a fine mind ' s musings . Alastor was published only to be savagely attacked , contemptuously ignored . Shelley sent a copy to Southey , a former friend , and another to Godwin . Neither acknowledged the gift .	Only Mary ' s praise sustained him in his disappointment . She understood completely . Not a thought nor a cadence was missed in her summary of appreciation .	`` You have made the labor worth while '' , he said to her , smiling .`` And in the future , since I write for a public of one , I can save the poor publishers from wasting their money '' .	`` A public of one '' , Mary echoed reprovingly .`` How can you say such a thing ? ? There will be thousands who will thrill to the loveliness of Alastor . There are some even now . What about that dear , clever Mr . Thynne ? ? I am sure he is in raptures '' .	`` Poor Mr . Thynne , he always has to be trotted out for my encouragement '' .	`` There are other Mr . Thynnes . Not everyone is bewitched by Byron ' s caliphs and harem beauties '' .	Mary ' s supercritical attitude toward Byron had nothing to do with his moral disrepute . She was resentful of his easy success as compared with Shelley ' s failure . The same month that Alastor was published , Murray sold twenty thousand copies of The Siege Of Corinth , a slovenly bit of Byronism that even Shelley ' s generosity rebelled at .The lordly poet was at low-water mark . The careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent . On all sides doors were being slammed in his face . The previous scandals , gaily diverting as they were , had only served to increase his popularity . Now , under the impact of his wife ' s disclosures , he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a limit to tolerance , however brilliant , however far-famed the offender might be . He tried defiance and openly flaunted his devotion to his half sister , but he soon saw , as did she , that this course if persisted in would involve them in a common ruin . For the moment there was no woman in his life , and it was this vacuum that had given Claire her opportunity .	But the liaison successfully started in the last days of autumn was now languishing . Byron , since the separation from his wife had been living in a smallish house in Piccadilly Terrace . He refused to bring Claire to it even as an occasional visitor , claiming that his every move was watched by spies of the Milbankes .
	Beckworth handed the pass to the colonel . He had thought that the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction of serving his own order , but the slip of paper was folded and absently thrust into the colonel ' s belt . Despite his yearning , the colonel would not go down to see the men come through the lines . He would remain in the tent , waiting impatiently , occupied by some trivial task .	-- Beckworth .	-- Sir ? ?	-- Fetch me the copies of everything B and C companies have requisitioned in the last six months .	-- The last six months , sir ? ?	-- You heard me . There ' s a lot of waste going on here . It ' s got to stop . I want to take a look . This is no damned holiday , Beckworth . Get busy .	-- Yes , sir .	Beckworth left the tent . Below he could see the bright torches lighting the riverbank . He glanced back . The colonel crouched tensely on one of the folding chairs , methodically tearing at his thumbnail .The bombproof was a low-ceilinged structure of heavy timbers covered with earth . It stood some fifty paces from the edge of the bank . From the outside , it seemed no more than a low drumlin , a lump on the dark earth . A crude ladder ran down to a wooden floor . Two slits enabled observers to watch across the river . The place smelled strongly of rank , fertile earth , rotting wood and urine . The plank floor was slimed beneath Watson ' s boots . At least the Union officer had been decent enough to provide a candle . There was no place to sit , but Watson walked slowly from the ladder to the window slits and back , stooping slightly to avoid striking his head on the heavy beams . In the corner was the soldier with the white flag . He stood stiffly erect , clutching the staff , his body half hidden by the limp cloth . Watson hardly looked at him . The man had come floundering aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last instant , brandishing the flag of truce . Someone had hauled him over the side , and he had remained silent while they crossed .	An officer with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank . The men in the boats had started yelling happily at first sight of the officer , two of them calling him Billy . When the boat had touched , the weaker ones and the two wounded men had been lifted out and carried away by the soldiers . Watson had presented his pouch and been led to the bombproof . The officer had told him that both lists must be checked . Watson had given his name and asked for a safe-conduct pass . The officer , surprised , said he would have to see . Watson had nodded absently and muttered that he would check the lists himself later . He had peered through the darkness at the rampart . The men he would take back across the river stood there , but he turned away from them . He wanted no part of the emotions of the exchange , no memory of the joy and gratitude that other men felt . He had hoped to be alone in the bombproof , but the soldier had followed him . Though Watson carefully ignored the man , he could not deny his presence . Perhaps it would be better to speak to him , since silence could not exorcise his form . Watson glanced briefly at him , seeing only a body rigidly erect behind the languid banner .	-- We won ' t be too long . If my pass is approved , I may be a half hour .	The soldier answered in a curious , muffled voice , his lips barely moving . Watson turned away and did not see the man ' s knees buckle and his body sag .	-- Yes , sir .	He had acknowledged the man . It was easier to think now , Watson decided . The stiff figure in the corner no longer blocked his thoughts . He paced slowly , stooping , staring at the damp , slippery floor . He tried to order the words of the three Union officers , seeking to create some coherent portrait of the dead boy . But he groped blindly . His lack of success steadily eroded his interest . He stopped pacing , leaned against the dank , timbered wall and let his mind drift . A feeling of futility , an enervation of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known , seeped through him . What in the name of God was he doing , crouched in a timbered pit on the wrong bank of the river ? ? Why had he crossed the dark water , to bring back a group of reclaimed soldiers or to skulk in a foul-smelling hole ? ?	He grew annoyed and at the same time surprised at that emotion . He was conscious of a growing sense of absurdity . Hillman had written it all out , hadn ' t he ? ? Wasn ' t the report official enough ? ? What did he hope to accomplish here ? ? Hillman had ordered him not to leave the far bank . Prompted by a guilty urge , he had disobeyed the order of a man he respected . For what ? ? To tell John something he would find out for himself .	The figure in the corner belched loudly , a deep , liquid eruption . Watson snorted and then laughed aloud . Exactly ! !	The soldier ' s voice was muffled again , stricken with chagrin . He clutched the staff , and his dark eyes blinked apologetically .	-- ' scuse me , sir .	-- Let ' s get out of here .	Watson ran up the ladder and stood for a second sucking in the cool air that smelled of mud and river weeds . To his left , the two skiffs dented their sharp bows into the soft bank . The flat-bottomed boat swung slowly to the pull of the current . A soldier held the end of a frayed rope .	Three Union guards appeared , carrying their rifles at ready . Watson stared at them curiously . They were stocky men , well fed and clean-shaven , with neat uniforms and sturdy boots . Behind them shambled a long column of weak , tattered men . The thin gray figures raised a hoarse , cawing cry like the call of a bird flock . They moved toward the skiffs with shocking eagerness , elbowing and shoving . Four men were knocked down , but did not attempt to rise . They crept down the muddy slope toward the waiting boats . The Union soldiers grounded arms and settled into healthy , indifferent postures to watch the feeble boarding of the skiffs . The crawling men tried to rise and fell again . No one moved to them . Watson watched two of them flounder into the shallow water and listened to their voices beg shrilly . In a confused , soaked and stumbling shift of bodies and lifting arms , the two men were dragged into the same skiff . The third crawling man forced himself erect . He swayed like a drunkard , his arms milling in slow circles . He paced forward unsteadily , leaning too far back , his head tilted oddly . His steps were short and stiff , and , with his head thrown back , his progress was a supercilious strut . He appeared to be peering haughtily down his nose at the crowded and unclean vessel that would carry him to freedom . He stalked into the water and fell heavily over the side of the flat-bottomed barge , his weight nearly swamping the craft . Watson looked for the fourth man . He had reached the three passive guards ; ; he crept in an incertain manner , patting the ground before him . The guards did not look at him . The figure on the earth halted , seemingly bewildered . He sank back on his thin haunches like a weary hound . Then he began to crawl again . Watson watched the creeping figure . He felt a spectator interest . Would the man make it or not ? ? If only there was a clock for him to crawl against . If he failed to reach the riverbank in five minutes , say , then the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping in the mud . Say three minutes to make it sporting . Still the guards did not move , but stood inert , aloof from the slow-scrambling man . The figure halted , and Watson gasped . The man began to creep in the wrong direction , deceived by a slight rise in the ground ! ! He turned slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart . Watson raced for him , his boots slamming the soft earth .	The guards came to life with astonishing menace . They spun and flung their rifles up . Watson gesticulated wildly . One man dropped to his knee for better aim .	-- Let me help him , for the love of God ! !	The guards lowered their rifles and their rifles and peered at Watson with sullen , puzzled faces . Watson pounded to the crawling man and stopped , panting heavily . He reached down and closed his fingers on the man ' s upper arm . Beneath his clutch , a flat strip of muscle surged on the bone . Watson bent awkwardly and lifted the man to his feet . Watson stared into a cadaverous face . Two clotted balls the color of mucus rolled between fiery lids . Light sticks of fingers , the tips gummy with dark earth , patted at Watson ' s throat . The man ' s voice was a sweet , patient whisper .	-- Henry said that he ' d take my arm and get me right there . But you ain ' t Henry .	-- no .	-- It don ' t matter . Is it far ? ?	How far could it be , Watson thought bleakly , how far can a blind man crawl ? ? Another body length or all the rest of his nighted life ? ?	-- Not far .	-- You talk deep . Not like us fellas . It raises the voice , bein in camp . You Secesh ? ?	-- yes . Come on , now . Can you walk ? ?	-- Why , course I can . I can walk real good .	Watson stumbled down the bank . The man leaned his frail body against Watson ' s shoulder . He was no heavier than a child . Watson paused for breath . The man wheezed weakly , his fetid breath beating softly against Watson ' s neck . His sweet whisper came after great effort .	-- Oh , Christ . I wish you was Henry . He promised to take me .	-- hush . We ' re almost there .	Watson supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure over the bow of the nearest skiff . The man swayed on a thwart , turning his ruined eyes from side to side . Watson turned away , sickened for the first time in many months . He heard the patient voice calling .	-- Henry ? ? Where are you , Henry ? ?	-- Make him lie down ! !	Watson snatched a deep breath . He had not meant to shout . He stood with his back to the skiff . The men mewed and scratched , begging to be taken away . Watson spoke bewilderedly to the dark night flecked with pine-knot torches .	-- Goddamn you ! ! What do you do to them ? ?	Intelligence jabbed at him accusingly . He was angry , sickened . He had not felt that during the afternoon . No , nor later . All his emotions had been inward , self-conscious . In war , on a night like this , it was only the outward emotions that mattered , what could be flung out into the darkness to damage others . Yes . That was it . He was sure of it .	John ' s type of man allowed this sort of thing to happen . What a fool he had been to think of his brother ! ! So Charles was dead . What did it matter ? ? His name had been crossed off a list . Already his cool body lay in the ground . What words had any meaning ? ? What had he thought of , to go to John , grovel and beg understanding ? ? To confess with a canvas chair as a prie-dieu , gouging at his heart until a rough and stupid hand bade him rise and go ? ? Men were slaughtered every day , tumbled into eternity like so many torn parcels flung down a portable chute . What made him think John had a right to witness his brother ' s humiliation ? ? What right had John to any special consideration ? ? Was John better , more deserving ? ? To hell with John . Let him chafe with impatience to see Charles , rip open the note with trembling hands and read the formal report in Hillman ' s beautiful , schoolmaster ' s hand . John would curse . He believed that brave boys didn ' t cry .	Watson spat on the ground . He was grimly satisfied . He had stupidly thought himself compelled to ease his brother ' s pain . Now he knew perfectly that he had but longed to increase his own suffering .
	I would not want to be one of those writers who begin each morning by exclaiming , `` O Gogol , O Chekhov , O Thackeray and Dickens , what would you have made of a bomb shelter ornamented with four plaster-of-Paris ducks , a birdbath , and three composition gnomes with long beards and red mobcaps '' ? ? As I say , I wouldn ' t want to begin a day like this , but I often wonder what the dead would have done . But the shelter is as much a part of my landscape as the beech and horse-chestnut trees that grow on the ridge . I can see it from this window where I write . It was built by the Pasterns , and stands on the acre of ground that adjoins our property . It bulks under a veil of thin , new grass , like some embarrassing fact of physicalness , and I think Mrs . Pastern set out the statuary to soften its meaning . It would have been like her . She was a pale woman . Sitting on her terrace , sitting in her parlor , sitting anywhere , she ground an axe of self-esteem . Offer her a cup of tea and she would say , `` Why , these cups look just like a set I gave to the Salvation Army last year '' . Show her the new swimming pool and she would say , slapping her ankle , `` I suppose this must be where you breed your gigantic mosquitoes '' . Hand her a chair and she would say , `` Why , it ' s a nice imitation of those Queen Anne chairs I inherited from Grandmother Delancy '' . These trumps were more touching than they were anything else , and seemed to imply that the nights were long , her children ungrateful , and her marriage bewilderingly threadbare . Twenty years ago , she would have been known as a golf widow , and the sum of her manner was perhaps one of bereavement . She usually wore weeds , and a stranger watching her board a train might have guessed that Mr . Pastern was dead , but Mr . Pastern was far from dead . He was marching up and down the locker room of the Grassy Brae Golf Club shouting , `` Bomb Cuba ! ! Bomb Berlin ! ! Let ' s throw a little nuclear hardware at them and show them who ' s boss '' . He was brigadier of the club ' s locker-room light infantry , and at one time or another declared war on Russia , Czechoslovakia , Yugoslavia , and China .	It all began on an autumn afternoon -- and who , after all these centuries , can describe the fineness of an autumn day ? ? One might pretend never to have seen one before , or , to more purpose , that there would never be another like it . The clear and searching sweep of sun on the lawns was like a climax of the year ' s lights . Leaves were burning somewhere and the smoke smelled , for all its ammoniac acidity , of beginnings . The boundless blue air was stretched over the zenith like the skin of a drum . Leaving her house one late afternoon , Mrs . Pastern stopped to admire the October light . It was the day to canvass for infectious hepatitis . Mrs . Pastern had been given sixteen names , a bundle of literature , and a printed book of receipts . It was her work to go among her neighbors and collect their checks . Her house stood on a rise of ground , and before she got into her car she looked at the houses below . Charity as she knew it was complex and reciprocal , and almost every roof she saw signified charity . Mrs . Balcolm worked for the brain . Mrs . Ten Eyke did mental health . Mrs . Trenchard worked for the blind . Mrs . Horowitz was in charge of diseases of the nose and throat . Mrs . Trempler was tuberculosis , Mrs . Surcliffe was Mothers ' March of Dimes , Mrs . Craven was cancer , and Mrs . Gilkson did the kidney . Mrs . Hewlitt led the birthcontrol league , Mrs . Ryerson was arthritis , and way in the distance could be seen the slate roof of Ethel Littleton ' s house , a roof that signified gout .	Mrs . Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer . It was her destiny ; ; it was her life . Her mother had done it before her , and even her old grandmother , who had collected money for smallpox and unwed mothers . Mrs . Pastern had telephoned most of her neighbors in advance , and most of them were ready for her . She experienced none of the suspense of some poor stranger selling encyclopedias . Here and there she stayed to visit and drink a glass of sherry . The contributions were ahead of what she had got the previous year , and while the money , of course , was not hers , it excited her to stuff her kit with big checks . She stopped at the Surcliffes ' after dusk , and had a Scotch-and-soda . She stayed too late , and when she left , it was dark and time to go home and cook supper for her husband .`` I got a hundred and sixty dollars for the hepatitis fund '' , she said excitedly when he walked in .`` I did everybody on my list but the Blevins and the Flannagans . I want to get my kit in tomorrow morning -- would you mind doing them while I cook the dinner '' ? ?	`` But I don ' t know the Flannagans '' , Charlie Pastern said .	`` Nobody does , but they gave me ten last year '' .	He was tired , he had his business worries , and the sight of his wife arranging pork chops in the broiler only seemed like an extension of a boring day . He was happy enough to take the convertible and race up the hill to the Blevins ' , thinking that they might give him a drink . But the Blevins were away ; ; their maid gave him an envelope with a check in it and shut the door . Turning in at the Flannagans ' driveway , he tried to remember if he had ever met them . The name encouraged him , because he always felt that he could handle the Irish . There was a glass pane in the front door , and through this he could see into a hallway where a plump woman with red hair was arranging flowers .	`` Infectious hepatitis '' , he shouted heartily .	She took a good look at herself in the mirror before she turned and , walking with very small steps , started toward the door .`` Oh , please come in '' , she said . The girlish voice was nearly a whisper . She was not a girl , he could see . Her hair was dyed , and her bloom was fading , and she must have been crowding forty , but she seemed to be one of those women who cling to the manners and graces of a pretty child of eight .`` Your wife just called '' , she said , separating one word from another , exactly like a child .`` And I am not sure that I have any cash -- any money , that is -- but if you will wait just a minute I will write you out a check if I can find my checkbook . Won ' t you step into the living room , where it ' s cozier '' ? ?	A fire had just been lighted , he saw , and things had been set out for drinks , and , like any stray , his response to these comforts was instantaneous . Where was Mr . Flannagan , he wondered . Travelling home on a late train ? ? Changing his clothes upstairs ? ? Taking a shower ? ? At the end of the room there was a desk heaped with papers , and she began to riffle these , making sighs and and noises of girlish exasperation .`` I am terribly sorry to keep you waiting '' , she said , `` but won ' t you make yourself a little drink while you wait ? ? Everything ' s on the table '' .	`` What train does Mr . Flannagan come out on '' ? ?	`` Mr . Flannagan is away '' , she said . Her voice dropped .`` Mr . Flannagan has been away for six weeks .'' 	`` I ' ll have a drink , then , if you ' ll have one with me '' .	`` If you will promise to make it weak '' .	`` Sit down '' , he said , `` and enjoy your drink and look for your checkbook later . The only way to find things is to relax '' .	All in all , they had six drinks . She described herself and her circumstances unhesitatingly . Mr . Flannagan manufactured plastic tongue depressors . He travelled all over the world . She didn ' t like to travel . Planes made her feel faint , and in Tokyo , where she had gone that summer , she had been given raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home . She and her husband had formerly lived in New York , where she had many friends , but Mr . Flannagan thought the country would be safer in case of war . She would rather live in danger than die of loneliness and boredom . She had no children ; ; she had made no friends .`` I ' ve seen you , though , before '' , she said with enormous coyness , patting his knee .`` I ' ve seen you walking your dogs on Sunday and driving by in the convertible .'' 	The thought of this lonely woman sitting at her window touched him , although he was even more touched by her plumpness . Sheer plumpness , he knew , is not a vital part of the body and has no procreative functions . It serves merely as an excess cushion for the rest of the carcass . And knowing its humble place in the scale of things , why did he , at this time of life , seem almost ready to sell his soul for plumpness ? ? The remarks she made about the sufferings of a lonely woman seemed so broad at first that he didn ' t know what to make of them , but after the sixth drink he put his arm around her and suggested that they go upstairs and look for her checkbook there .	`` I ' ve never done this before '' , she said later , when he was arranging himself to leave . Her voice shook with feeling , and he thought it lovely . He didn ' t doubt her truthfulness , although he had heard the words a hundred times .`` I ' ve never done this before '' , they always said , shaking their dresses down over their white shoulders .`` I ' ve never done this before '' , they always said , waiting for the elevator in the hotel corridor .`` I ' ve never done this before '' , they always said , pouring another whiskey .`` I ' ve never done this before '' , they always said , putting on their stockings . On ships at sea , on railroad trains , in summer hotels with mountain views , they always said , `` I ' ve never done this before '' .`` Where have you been '' ? ? Mrs . Pastern asked sadly , when he came in .`` It ' s after eleven '' .	`` I had a drink with the Flannagans '' .	`` She told me he was in Germany '' .	`` He came home unexpectedly '' .	Charlie ate some supper in the kitchen and went into the TV room to hear the news .`` Bomb them '' ! ! He shouted .`` Throw a little nuclear hardware at them ! ! Show them who ' s boss '' ! ! But in bed he had trouble sleeping . He thought first of his son and daughter , away at college . He loved them . It was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known . Then he played nine imaginary holes of golf , choosing his handicap , his irons , his stance , his opponents , and his weather in detail , but the green of the links seemed faded in the light of his business worries . His money was tied up in a Nassau hotel , an Ohio pottery works , and a detergent for window-washing , and luck had been running against him . His worries harried him up out of bed , and he lighted a cigarette and went to the window . In the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves . During the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses at the track , and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel tickets would still be lying , like leaves , in the gutters near Belmont and Saratoga . Maple and ash , beech and elm , one hundred to win on Three in the fourth , fifty to win on Six in the third , one hundred to win on Two in the eighth . Children walking home from school would scuff through what seemed to be his foliage . Then , getting back into bed , he thought unashamedly of Mrs . Flannagan , planning where they would next meet and what they would do . There are , he thought , so few true means of forgetfulness in this life that why should he shun the medicine even when the medicine seemed , as it did , a little crude ? ?
It was not as though she noted clearly that her nephews had not been to see her for ten years , not since their last journey eastward to witness their Uncle Izaak being lowered into the rocky soil ; ; that aside from due notification of certain major events in their lives ( two marriages , two births , one divorce ) , Christmas and Easter cards of the traditional sort had been the only thin link she had with them through the widowed years . Her thoughts were not discrete . But there was a look about her mouth as though she were tasting lemons .	She grasped the chair arms and brought her thin body upright , like a bird alert for flight . She turned and walked stiffly into the parlor to the dainty-legged escritoire , warped and cracked now from fifty years in an atmosphere of sea spray . There she extracted two limp vellum sheets and wrote off the letters , one to Abel , one to Mark .	Once her trembling hand , with the pen grasped tight in it , was pressed against the paper the words came sharply , smoothly , as authoritatively as they would dropping from her own lips . And the stiffly regal look of them , she saw grimly , lacked the quaver of age which , thwarting the efforts of her amazing will , ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged string .`` Please come down as soon as you conveniently can '' , the upright letters stalked from the broad-nibbed pen , `` I have an important matter to discuss with you '' . To Abel : `` I am afraid there is not much to amuse small children here . I should be obliged if you could make other arrangements for your daughters . You may stay as long as you wish , of course , but if arranging for the care of the girls must take time into account , I think a day or two should be enough to finish our business in '' . To Mark : `` Please give my regards to Myra '' .	She signed the letters quickly , stamped them , and placed them on the hall table for Raphael to mail in town . Then she went back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water .	`` My nephews will be coming down '' , she said that evening as Angelina brought her dinner into the dining room , the whole meal on a vast linen-covered tray . She looked at the girl speculatively from eyes which had paled with the years ; ; from the early evening lights of them which had first startled Izaak to look at her in an uncousinly way , they had faded to a near-absence of color which had , possibly from her constant looking at the water , something of the light of the sea in them .	Angelina placed the tray on the table and with a flick of dark wrist drew off the cloth . She smiled , and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face .`` That will be so nice for you , Mrs . Packard '' , she said . Her voice was ripe and full and her teeth flashed again in Sicilian brilliance before the warm curved lips met and her mouth settled in repose .	`` Um '' , said the old lady , and brought her eyes down to the tray .`` You remember them , I suppose '' ? ? She glinted suspiciously at the dish before her : `` blowfish . I hope Raphael bought them whole '' .	Angelina stepped back , her eyes roaming the tray for omissions . Then she looked at the old woman again , her eyes calm .	`` Yes '' , she said , `` I remember that they came here every summer . I used to play with the older one sometimes , when he ' d let me . Abel '' ? ? The name fell with lazy affectionate remembrance from her lips . For an instant the old aunt felt something indefinable flash through her smile . She would have said triumph . Then Angelina turned and with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen .	Jessica Packard lifted her head and followed the retreating figure , her eyes resting nearly closed on the unself-conscious rise and fall of the rounded hips . For a moment she held her face to the empty doorway ; ; then she snorted and groped for her fork .	There ' s no greater catastrophe in the universe , she reflected dourly , impaling tender green beans on the silver fork , than the dwindling away of a family . Procreation , expansion , proliferation -- these are the laws of living things , with the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments : oblivion . When the fate of the individual is visited on the group , then ( the warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed her head forward belligerently ) , ah , then the true bitterness of existence could be tasted . And indeed the young garden beans were brackish in her mouth .	She was the last living of the older generation . What had once been a widespread family -- at one time , she knew , there were enough Packards to populate an entire county -- had now narrowed down to the two boys , Abel and Mark . She swung her eyes up to the blue of the window , her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans . What hope lay in the nephews , she asked the intensifying light out there , with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced , having sired two girl children , with none to bear on the Packard name ? ?	She ate . It seemed to her , as it seemed each night , that the gloom drew itself in and became densest at the table ' s empty chairs , giving her the frequent illusion that she dined with shadows . Here , too , she talked low , quirking her head at one or another of the places , most often at Izaak ' s armchair which faced her across the long table . Or it might have been the absent nephews she addressed , consciously playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early years .	She thought again of her children , those two who had died young , before the later science which might have saved them could attach even a label to their separate malignancies . The girl , her first , she barely remembered . It could have been anyone ' s infant , for it had not survived the bassinet . But the boy the boy had been alive yesterday . Each successive movement in his growing was recorded on the unreeling film inside her . He ran on his plump sticks of legs , freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the camera had caught and held on the paling photographs , all carefully placed and glued and labeled , resting in the fat plush album in the bottom drawer of the escritoire . In the cruel clearness of her memory the boy remained unchanged , quick with the delight of laughter , and the pain with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable to her . It was one with the desolate rocks and the alien water on those days when she hated the sea .The brothers drove down together in Mark ' s small red sports car , Mark at the wheel . They rarely spoke . Abel sat and regarded the farm country which , spreading out from both sides of the road , rolled greenly up to where the silent white houses and long barns and silos nested into the tilled fields . He saw the land with a stranger ' s eyes , all the old familiarness gone . And it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger , impervious , complete in itself . There was stability there , too -- a color which his life had had once . That is what childhood is , he told himself . Solid , settled lost . In the stiff neutral lines of the telephone poles he saw the no-nonsense pen strokes of Aunt Jessica ' s letter . What bad grace , what incredible selfishness he and Mark had shown . The boyhood summers preceding their uncle ' s funeral might never have been . They had closed over , absolutely , with the sealing of old Izaak ' s grave . The small car flew on relentlessly . The old woman , stubbornly reigning in the house above the crashing waters took on an ominous reality . Abel moved and adjusted his long legs .	`` I suppose it has to do with the property '' , Mark had said over the telephone when they had discussed their receipt of the letters . Not until the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea , and feel his contrition blotted out in one shameful moment of covetousness . He and Mark were the last of the family , and there lay the Cape Ann property which had seemed to have no end , stretching from horizon to horizon , in those golden days of summer .	Now Abel turned his head to look at his brother . Mark held the wheel loosely , but his fingers curved around it in a purposeful way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he ' d make in the years to come . His sandy hair was already beginning to thin and recede at the sides , and Abel looked quickly away . Mark easily looked years older than himself , settled , his world comfortably categorized .	The vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they approached the sea .`` She didn ' t mention bringing Myra '' , Mark said , maneuvering the car into the next lane .`` She ' s probably getting old -- crotchety , I mean -- and we figured uh-uh , better not . They ' ve never met , you know . But Myra wouldn ' t budge without an express invitation . I feel kind of bad about it '' . He gave Abel a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel , hugging it to him , and Abel caught this briefest of allusions to guilt .	`` I imagine the old girl hasn ' t missed us much '' , Mark added , his eyes on the road . Abel ignored the half-expressed bid for confirmation . He smiled . It was barely possible that his brother was right .	He could tell they were approaching the sea . The air took on a special strength now that they ' d left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind . There was the smell of the coast , like a primeval memory , composed of equal parts salt water , clams , seaweed and northern air . He turned from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy ' s eye again the great fieldstone house which , built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor , had been Izaak ' s bride-gift to his cousin-wife as the last century ended .	Mark ' s thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own , climbing the same crags in dirty white sneakers , clambering out on top of the headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant .`` Remember the Starbird ? ?'' Mark asked , and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road , the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came down .	`` The Starbird , '' Abel said . There was the day Uncle Izaak had , in an unexpected grandiose gesture , handed over the pretty sloop to Abel for keeps , on condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever younger the boy wished . The two of them had developed into a remarkable sailing team all of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth and their brotherhood knitted them together as no other time or circumstance could . They seemed then to have had a single mind and body , a mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth , casually . He saw the Starbird as she lay , her slender mast up and gently turning , its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus sky . Both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her waiting , ready , for the two of them to run up her sails . The Starbird had been long at the bottom of the bay .	They came unexpectedly upon the sea . Meeting it without preparation as they did , robbed of anticipation , a common disappointment seized them . They were climbing the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly probed solid blackness , became two parallel luminous tubes which broadened out into a faint mist of light and ended . Mark stopped the car and switched off the lights and they sat looking at the water , which , there being no moon out , at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an absence of stars .
His eyes were old and they never saw well , but heated with whisky they ' d glare at my noise , growing red and raising up his rage . I decided I hated the Pedersen kid too , dying in our kitchen while I was away where I couldn ' t watch , dying just to entertain Hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall , Pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow , snoring and whistling . Oh he ' d not care about the Pedersen kid . He ' d not care about getting waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain . That would make him mad enough if he was sober . I didn ' t hurry though it was cold and the Pedersen kid was in the kitchen .	He was all shoveled up like I thought he ' d be . I pushed at his shoulder , calling his name . I think his name stopped the snoring but he didn ' t move except to roll a little when I shoved him . The covers slid down his skinny neck so I saw his head , fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed , but his face was turned to the wall -- there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster -- and I thought , Well you don ' t look much like a pig-drunk bully now . I couldn ' t be sure he was still asleep . He was a cagey sonofabitch . I shook him a little harder and made some noise .`` Pap-pap-pap-hey '' , I said .	I was leaning too far over . I knew better . He always slept close to the wall so you had to lean to reach him . Oh he was smart . It put you off . I knew better but I was thinking of the Pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough . When his arm came up I ducked away but it caught me on the side of the neck , watering my eyes , and I backed off to cough . Pa was on his side , looking at me , his eyes winking , the hand that had hit me a fist in the pillow .	`` Get the hell out of here '' .	I didn ' t say anything , trying to get my throat clear , but I watched him . He was like a mean horse to come at from the rear . It was better , though , he ' d hit me . He was bitter when he missed .	`` Get the hell out of here '' .	`` Big Hans sent me . He told me to wake you '' .	`` A fat hell on Big Hans . Get out of here '' .	`` He found the Pedersen kid by the crib '' .	`` Get the hell out '' .	Pa pulled at the covers . He was tasting his mouth .	`` The kid ' s froze good . Hans is rubbing him with snow . He ' s got him in the kitchen '' .	`` Pedersen '' ? ?	`` No , Pa . It ' s the Pedersen kid . The kid '' .	`` Nothing to steal from the crib '' .	`` Not stealing , Pa . He was just lying there . Hans found him froze . That ' s where he was when Hans found him '' .	Pa laughed .	`` I ain ' t hid nothing in the crib '' .	`` You don ' t understand , Pa . The Pedersen kid . The kid '' -- 	`` I goddamn well understand '' .	Pa had his head up , glaring , his teeth gnawing at the place where he ' d grown a mustache once .	`` I goddamn well understand . You know I don ' t want to see Pedersen . That cock . Why should I ? ? What did he come for , hey ? ? God dammit , get . And don ' t come back . Find out something . You ' re a fool . Both you and Hans . Pedersen . That cock . Don ' t come back . Out . Out '' .	He was shouting and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow . He had long black hairs on his wrist . They curled around the cuff of his nightshirt .	`` Big Hans made me come . Big Hans said '' -- 	`` A fat hell on Big Hans . He ' s an even bigger fool than you are . Fat , hey ? ? I taught him , dammit , and I ' ll teach you . Out . You want me to drop my pot '' ? ?	He was about to get up so I got out , slamming the door . He was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep . Then he threw things . Once he went after Hans and dumped his pot over the banister . Pa ' d been shit-sick in that pot . Hans got an axe . He didn ' t even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part of Pa ' s door down before he stopped . He might not have gone that far if Pa hadn ' t been locked in laughing fit to shake the house . That pot put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it . I always felt the memory was present in both of them , stirring in their chests like a laugh or a growl , as eager as an animal to be out . I heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs .	Hans had laid steaming towels over the kid ' s chest and stomach . He was rubbing snow on the kid ' s legs and feet . Water from the snow and water from the towels had run off the kid to the table where the dough was , and the dough was turning pasty , sticking to the kid ' s back and behind .	`` Ain ' t he going to wake up '' ? ?	`` What about your pa '' ? ?	`` He was awake when I left '' .	`` What ' d he say ? ? Did you get the whisky '' ? ?	`` He said a fat hell on Big Hans '' .	`` Don ' t be smart . Did you ask him about the whisky '' ? ?	`` Yeah '' .	`` Well '' ? ?	`` He said a fat hell on Big Hans '' .	`` Don ' t be smart . What ' s he going to do '' ? ?	`` Go back to sleep most likely '' .	`` You ' d best get that whisky '' .	`` You go . Take the axe . Pa ' s scared to hell of axes '' .	`` Listen to me , Jorge , I ' ve had enough to your sassing . This kid ' s froze bad . If I don ' t get some whisky down him he might die . You want the kid to die ? ? Do you ? ? Well , get your pa and get that whisky '' .	`` Pa don ' t care about the kid '' .	`` Jorge '' .	`` Well he don ' t . He don ' t care at all , and I don ' t care to get my head busted neither . He don ' t care , and I don ' t care to have his shit flung on me . He don ' t care about anybody . All he cares about is his whisky and that dry crack in his face . Get pig-drunk -- that ' s what he wants . He don ' t care about nothing else at all . Nothing . Not Pedersen ' s kid neither . That cock . Not the kid neither '' .	`` I ' ll get the spirits '' , Ma said .	I ' d wound Big Hans up tight . I was ready to jump but when Ma said she ' d get the whisky it surprised him like it surprised me , and he ran down . Ma never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off . Not any more . Not for years . The first thing every morning when she washed her face she could see the scar on her chin where he ' d cut her with a boot cleat , and maybe she saw him heaving it again , the dirty sock popping out as it flew . It should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for Big Hans to remember going after the axe while he was still spattered with Pa ' s yellow sick insides .	`` No you won ' t '' , Big Hans said .	`` Yes , Hans , if they ' re needed '' , Ma said .	Hans shook his head but neither of us tried to stop her . If we had , then one of us would have had to go instead . Hans rubbed the kid with more snow rubbed rubbed .	`` I ' ll get more snow '' , I said . I took the pail and shovel and went out on the porch . I don ' t know where Ma went . I thought she ' d gone upstairs and expected to hear she had . She had surprised Hans like she had surprised me when she said she ' d go , and then she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have , because when I came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and Hans was holding it angrily by the throat .	Oh , he was being queer and careful , pawing about in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm . He was awful angry because he ' d thought Ma was going to do something big , something heroic even , especially for her I know him I know him we felt the same sometimes while Ma wasn ' t thinking about that at all , not anything like that . There was no way of getting even . It wasn ' t like getting cheated at the fair . They were always trying so you got to expect it . Now Hans had given Ma something of his -- we both had when we thought she was going straight to Pa -- something valuable ; ; but since she didn ' t know we ' d given it to her , there was no easy way of getting it back .	Hans cut the foil off finally and unscrewed the cap . He was put out too because there was only one way of understanding what she ' d done . Ma had found one of Pa ' s hiding places . She ' d found one and she hadn ' t said a word while Big Hans and I had hunted and hunted as we always did all winter , every winter since the spring that Hans had come and I had looked in the privy and found the first one . Pa had a knack for hiding . He knew we were looking and he enjoyed it . But now Ma . She ' d found it by luck most likely but she hadn ' t said anything and we didn ' t know how long ago it ' d been or how many other ones she ' d found , saying nothing . Pa was sure to find out . Sometimes he didn ' t seem to because he hid them so well he couldn ' t find them himself or because he looked and didn ' t find anything and figured he hadn ' t hid one after all or had drunk it up . But he ' d find out about this one because we were using it . A fool could see what was going on . If he found out Ma found it -- that ' d be bad . He took pride in his hiding . It was all the pride he had . I guess fooling Hans and me took doing . But he didn ' t figure Ma for much . He didn ' t figure her at all , and if he found out a woman it ' d be bad .	Hans poured some in a tumbler .	`` You going to put more towels on him '' ? ?	`` No '' .	`` Why not ? ? That ' s what he needs , something warm to his skin , don ' t he '' ? ?	`` Not where he ' s froze good . Heat ' s bad for frostbite . That ' s why I only put towels on his chest and belly . He ' s got to thaw slow . You ought to know that '' .	Colors on the towels had run .	Ma poked her toe in the kid ' s clothes .	`` What are we going to do with these '' ? ?	Big Hans began pouring whisky in the kid ' s mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was dripping from his chin .	`` Here , help me prop him up . I got hold his mouth open '' .	I didn ' t want to touch him and I hoped Ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid ' s clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and didn ' t make any move to .	`` Come on , Jorge '' .	`` All right '' .	`` Lift , don ' t shove lift '' .	`` O . K . , I ' m lifting '' .	I took him by the shoulders . His head flopped back . His mouth fell open . The skin on his neck was tight . He was cold all right .	`` Hold his head up . He ' ll choke '' .	`` His mouth is open '' .	`` His throat ' s shut . He ' ll choke '' .	`` He ' ll choke anyway '' .	`` Hold his head up '' .	`` I can ' t '' .	`` Don ' t hold him like that . Put your arms around him '' .	`` Well Jesus '' .	He was cold all right . I put my arm carefully around him . Hans had his fingers in the kid ' s mouth .	`` Now he ' ll choke for sure '' .	`` Shut up . Just hold him like I told you '' .	He was cold all right , and wet . I had my arm behind his back .
He was in his mid-fifties at this time , long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again , and it was almost a decade since he had sworn off lecturing . There was never a doubt any more how his structures would be received ; ; it was always the same unqualified success now . He could no longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no longer disputable as to its other values . Stowey Rummel was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality . He had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; ; he rose at half-past six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn flakes and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday ' s Herald Tribune and yesterday ' s Pittsburgh Gazette , then put on his high-topped farmer ' s shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop . This was an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks , some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil geologist . The debris of his other careers was piled everywhere ; ; a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying on its side on the window sill , vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting out into the air , masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through a whole house , visible all the way up through wire gratings on each floor . His files , desk , drafting board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos . Everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in visible form : his models , drawings , ten-foot canvases in monochromes from his painting days , and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books that looked as though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac . Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden Cycly Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of roller skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house . He worked standing , with his left hand in his pocket as though he were merely stopping for a moment , sketching with the surprised stare of one who was watching another person ' s hand . Sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him , sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved . It all seemed -- if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows -- as though this broken-nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler ' s neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss ' s work . This air of disengagement carried over to his apparent attitude toward his things , and people often mistook it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious routine . But he was not bored at all ; ; he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite wonderful that the world admired it , and he could not imagine why he should alter it . There are , after all , fortunate souls who hear everything , but only know how to listen to what is good for them , and Stowey was , as things go , a fortunate man .	He left his home the day after New Year ' s wearing a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and without a hat . He would wear this same costume in Florida , despite his wife Cleota ' s reminders over the past five days that he must take some cool clothes with him . But he was too busy to hear what she was saying . So they parted when she was in an impatient humor . When he was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon , feeling in his trouser cuffs for the ignition key which he had dropped a moment before , she came out of the house with an enormous Rumanian shawl over her head , which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad , and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window . Finding the key under his shoe , he started the engine , and while it warmed up he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog , and said , `` Defrost the refrigerator '' .	He saw the surprise in her face , and laughed as though it were the funniest expression he had ever seen . He kept on laughing until she started laughing with him . He had a deep voice which was full of good food she had cooked , and good humor ; ; an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it . He would settle himself into his seat to laugh . Whenever he laughed it was all he was doing . And she was made to fall in love with him again there in the rutted dirt driveway standing in the cold fog , mad as she was at his going away when he really didn ' t have to , mad at their both having got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a week to go by . She was forty-nine at this time , a lanky woman of breeding with an austere , narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple or some architecture that had been designed long ago for a stubborn sort of prayer . Her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair that fell to her shoulders . There was an air of blindness in her gray eyes , the startled-horse look that ultimately comes to some women who are born at the end of an ancestral line long since divorced from money-making and which , besides , has kept its estate intact . She was personally sloppy , and when she had colds would blow her nose in the same handkerchief all day and keep it , soaking wet , dangling from her waist , and when she gardened she would eat dinner with dirt on her calves . But just when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity of peasanthood she would disappear and come down bathed , brushed , and taking breaths of air , and even with her broken nails her hands would come to rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy , a grace of history , so to speak , and for an instant one saw how ferociously proud she was and adamant on certain questions of personal value . She even spoke differently when she was clean , and she was clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp .	`` Now drive carefully , for God ' s sake '' ! ! She called , trying to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure . But he did not notice , and was already backing the car down to the road , saying `` Toot-toot '' ! ! To the stump of a tree as he passed it , the same stump which had impaled the car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to have removed . She stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road . Then , when he had it pointed down the hill , he stopped to gaze at her through the window . She had begun to turn back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell . He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once . Now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said `` Toot '' ! ! Once more and roared off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked . She walked back to the house and entered , feeling herself returning , sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building . There is a death in all partings , she knew , and promptly put it out of her mind .	She enjoyed great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking all night , but it always seemed to her that being alone , especially alone in her house , was the realest part of life . Now she could let out the three parakeets without fear they would be stepped on or that Stowey would let them out one of the doors ; ; she could dust the plants , then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the middle on ; ; improvise cha-chas on the harp ; ; and finally , the best part of all , simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the newspapers , reading the ads as well as the news , registering nothing on her mind but letting her soul suspend itself above all wishing and desire . She did this now , comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows , of the silence outside , of the dark afternoon it was getting to be . She fell asleep leaning on her hand , hearing the house creaking as though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years , hearing the birds rustling in their cages and the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm . Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things : Stowey , yes , was on his way south , and the two boys were away in school , and nothing was burning on the stove , and Lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers . Then she fell asleep again as soddenly as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes . She stood up , smoothing her hair down , straightening her clothes , feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey coming in or going out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she glimpsed a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head writhe , and in a moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests . She went into the living room and turned on three lamps , then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn , illuminating the driveway . She knew she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at herself . They were both so young , after all , so unready for any final parting . How could it have been thirty years already , she wondered ? ? But yes , nineteen plus thirty was forty-nine , and she was forty-nine and she had been married at nineteen . She stood still over the leg of lamb , rubbing herbs into it , quite suddenly conscious of a nausea in her stomach and a feeling of wrath , a sensation of violence that started her shivering .
	But they all said , `` No , your time will come . Enjoy being a bride while you can '' .	There was no room for company in the tiny Weaning House ( where the Albright boys always took their brides , till they could get a house and a farm of their own ) . So when the Big House filled up and ran over , the sisters-in-law found beds for everyone in their own homes . And there was still not anything that Linda Kay could do .	So Linda Kay gave up asking , and accepted her reprieve . Without saying so , she was really grateful ; ; for to attend the dying was something she had never experienced , and certainly had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as Bobby Joe ' s wife . She had made curtains for all the windows of her little house , and she had kept it spotless and neat , shabby as it was , and cooked good meals for Bobby Joe . She had done all the things she had promised herself she would do , but she had not thought of this . People died , she would have said , in hospitals , or in cars on the highway at night .	Bobby Joe was gone all day now , not coming in for dinner and sometimes not for supper . When they first married he had been working in the fields all day , and she would get in the car and drive to wherever he was working , to take him a fresh hot meal . Now there was no work in the fields , nor would there be till it rained , and she did not know where he went . Not that she complained , or had any cause to . Four or five of the cousins from East Texas were about his age , so naturally they ran around together . There was no reason for her to ask what they did .	Thus a new pattern of days began to develop , for Granny Albright did not die . She lay still on the bed , her head hardly denting the pillow ; ; sometimes she opened her eyes and looked around , and sometimes she took a little milk or soup . They stopped expecting her to die the next minute , but only in the next day or two . Those who had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would not go home , for she might die any time ; ; but they might as well unpack their suitcases , for she might linger on .	So the pattern was established . When Linda Kay had put up her breakfast dishes and mopped her linoleum rugs , she would go to the Big House . There was not anything she could do there , but that was where everyone was , or would be . Bobby Joe and the boys would come by , say `` How ' s Granny '' ? ? And sit on the porch a while . The older men would be there at noon , and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off to the creek or drove down the road towards town .	The women and children stayed at the Albrights ' . The women , keeping their voices low as they worked around the house or sat in the living room , sounded like chickens shut up in a coop for the night . The children had to play away from the house ( in the barn loft or the pasture behind the barn ) , to maintain a proper quietness .	Off and on , all day , someone would be wiping at the powdery gray dust that settled over everything . The evaporative cooler had been moved to Granny ' s room , and her door was kept shut ; ; so that the rest of the house stayed open , though there was a question as to whether it was hotter or cooler that way .	The dust clogged their throats , and the heat parched them , so that the women were always making ice water . They had cleaned up an old ice box and begun to buy fifty-pound blocks of ice in town , as the electric refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for the crowds who ate and drank there .	One afternoon , as the women sat clucking softly , a new carload of people pulled up at the gate . It was a Cadillac , black grayed with the dust of the road , its windows closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of it would be cool and unwrinkled . They were an old fat couple ( as Linda Kay described them to herself ) , a thick middle-aged man , and a girl about ten or twelve .	There was much embracing , much exclaiming .`` Cousin Ada ! ! Cousin John '' ! !`` Cousin Lura '' ! !`` Cousin Howard '' ! !`` And how is she '' ? ?`` About the same , John , about the same '' .	All the women got up and offered their chairs , and when they were all seated again , the guests made their inquiries and their explanations .	`` We were on our vacation in Canada '' , Howard explained , in a muffled voice that must have been used to booming , `` and the news didn ' t catch up with us till we were nearly home . We came on as soon as we could '' .	There was the suggestion of ice water , and -- in spite of the protest `` We ' re not really thirsty '' -- Linda Kay , to escape the stuffy air and the smothering soft voices , hurried to the kitchen .	She filled a big pitcher and set it , with glasses , on a tray . Carrying it to the living room , she imagined the picture she made : tall and roundly slim , a bit sophisticated in her yellow sheath , with a graceful swingy walk that she had learned as a twirler with the school band . Almost immediately she was ashamed of herself for feeling vain , at such a time , in such a place , and she tossed back her long yellow hair , smiling shyly as she entered the room .	Howard ( the thick middle-aged man ) was looking at her . She felt the look and looked back because she could not help it , seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at first believed .	`` And who is this '' ? ? He asked , when she passed him a glass .	`` Oh that ' s Linda Kay '' , Mama Albright said fondly .`` She married our baby boy , Bobby Joe , this summer '' .	`` Let ' s see '' , Cousin Ada said .`` He ' s a right smart younger than the rest '' ? ?	`` Oh yes '' , Mama laughed .`` He ' s ten years younger than Ernest . We didn ' t expect him to come along ; ; thought for the longest he was a tumor '' .	This joke was not funny to Linda Kay , and she blushed , as she always did ; ; then , hearing the muffled boom of Howard ' s laughter , blushed redder .	`` Who is Howard , anyway '' ? ? She asked Bobby Joe that night .`` He makes me uncomfortable '' .	`` Oh he ' s a second cousin or something . He got in the oil business out at Odessa and lucked into some money '' .	`` How old is he '' ? ?	`` Gosh , I don ' t know . Thirty-five , I guess . He ' s been married and got this half-grown kid . If he bothers you , don ' t pay him any mind . He ' s just a big windbag '' . Bobby Joe was thinking about something else .`` Say , did you know they ' re fixing to have a two-day antelope season on the Double J '' ? ?	He was talking about antelope again when they woke up .`` Listen , I never had a chance to kill an antelope . There never was a season before , but now they want to thin ' em out on account of the drouth '' .	`` Did he ever visit here when he was a kid '' ? ? Linda Kay asked .	`` Who '' ? ?	`` Howard '' .	`` Hell , I don ' t know . When he was a kid I wasn ' t around '' .	Bobby Joe took a gun from behind the door , and with a quick `` Bye now '' was gone for the day .	Almost immediately Howard and his daughter Debora drove up in the Cadillac .	`` We ' re going after ice '' , Howard said , `` and thought maybe you ' d go along and keep us company '' .	There was really no reason to refuse , and Linda Kay had never ridden in a Cadillac .	Driving along the caliche-topped road to town , Howard talked . Finally he said , `` Tell me about yourself '' , and Linda Kay told him , because she thought herself that she had had an interesting life . She was such a well-rounded teenager , having been a twirler , Future Farmers sweetheart , and secretary of Future Homemakers . In her sophomore year she had started going steady with Bobby Joe , who was a football player , Future Homemakers sweetheart , and president of Future Farmers . It was easy to see that they were made for each other , and they knew what they wanted . Bobby Joe would be a senior this year , and he planned to graduate . But there was no need for Linda Kay to go on , since all she wanted in life was to make a home for Bobby Joe and ( blushing ) raise his children .	Howard sighed .`` You lucky kids '' , he said .`` I ' d give anything if I could have found a girl like you '' . Then he told Linda Kay about himself . Of course he couldn ' t say much , really , because of Debora , but Linda Kay could imagine what kind of woman his wife had been and what a raw deal he had got . It made her feel different about Howard .	She was going to tell Bobby Joe about how mistaken she had been , but he brought one of the cousins home for supper , and all they did was talk about antelope .	Bobby Joe was trying to get Linda Kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home .	`` Cook a whole antelope '' ? ? She exclaimed .`` Why , I couldn ' t even cook a piece of antelope steak ; ; I never even saw any '' .	`` Oh , you could . I want to roast the whole thing , and have it for the boys '' .	Linda Kay told him he couldn ' t do anything like that with his Grandma dying , and he said well they had to eat , didn ' t they , they weren ' t all dying . Linda Kay felt like going off to the bedroom to cry ; ; but they were going up to the Big House after supper , and she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a little .	Every night they all went to Mama and Papa Albright ' s , and sat on the open front porch , where they could get the breeze . It was full-of-the-moon ( or a little past ) , and nearly light as day . They all sat around and drank ice water , and the men smoked , and everybody had a good time . Once in a while they said what a shame it was , with Granny dying , but they all agreed she wouldn ' t have wanted it any other way .	That night the older men got to talking about going possum-hunting on a moonlight night . Bobby Joe and two or three of the other boys declared they had never been possum-hunting , and Uncle Bill Farnworth ( from Mama Albright ' s side of the family ) said he would just get up from there and take them , right then .	After they had left , some of the people moved around , to find more comfortable places to sit . There were not many chairs , so that some preferred to sit on the edge of the porch , resting their feet on the ground , and others liked to sit where they could lean back against the wall . Howard , who had been sitting against the wall , said he needed more fresh air , and took the spot on the edge of the porch where Bobby Joe had been sitting .	`` You ' ll be a darn sight more comfortable there , Howard '' , Ernest said , laughing , and they all laughed .	Linda Kay felt that she was not exactly more comfortable . Bobby Joe had been sitting close to her , touching her actually , and holding her hand from time to time , but it seemed at once that Howard sat much closer . Perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh , so that more of it seemed to come in contact with hers ; ; but she had never been so aware of anyone ' s flesh before .	Still she was not sorry he sat by her , but in fact was flattered . He had become the center of the company , such stories he had to tell . He had sold oil stock to Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in person ; ; he had helped fight an oil-well fire that raged six days and nights .
	`` But tell me , doctor , where do you plan to conduct the hatching '' ? ? Alex asked .	`` That will have to be in the hotel '' , the doctor retorted , confirming Alex ' s anticipations .`` What I want you to do is to go to the market with me early tomorrow morning and help smuggle the hen back into the hotel '' .	The doctor paid the bill and they repaired to the hotel , room number nine , to initiate Alex further into these undertakings .	The doctor opened the smallest of his cases , an unimposing straw bag , and exposed the contents for Alex ' s inspection . Inside , carefully packed in straw , were six eggs , but the eye of a poultry psychologist was required to detect what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside ; ; to Alex they were merely six not unusual hens ' eggs . There was little enough time to contemplate them , however ; ; in an instant the doctor was stalking across the room with an antique ledger in his hands , thoroughly eared and big as a table top . He placed it on Alex ' s lap .	`` This is my hen ledger '' , he informed him in an absorbed way .`` It ' s been going since 1908 when I was a junior in college . That first entry there is the Vermont Flumenophobe , the earliest and one of the most successful of my eighty-three varieties -- great big scapulars and hardly any primaries at all . Couldn ' t take them near a river , though , or they ' d squawk like a turkey cock the day before Thanksgiving '' .	The ledger was full of most precise information : date of laying , length of incubation period , number of chick reaching the first week , second week , fifth week , weight of hen , size of rooster ' s wattles and so on , all scrawled out in a hand that looked more Chinese than English , the most jagged and sprawling Alex had ever seen . Below these particulars was a series of alpha-beta-gammas connected by arrows and crosses which denoted the lineage of the breed . Alex ' s instruction was rapid , for the doctor had to go off to the Rue Ecole De Medecine to hear more speeches with only time for one sip of wine to sustain him through them all . But after the doctor ' s return that night Alex could see , from the high window in his own room , the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels , apparently giving its egg-hatching powers one final chance before it was replaced in its office by a sure-enough hen .	A knocking at Alex ' s door roused him at six o ' clock the following morning . It was the doctor , dressed and ready for the expedition to the market , and Alex was obliged to prepare himself in haste . The doctor stood about , waiting for Alex to dress , with a show of impatience , and soon they were moving , as quietly as could be , through the still-dark hallways , past the bedroom of the patronne , and so into the street . The market was not far and , once there , the doctor ' s sense of immediacy left him and he fell into a state of harmony with the birds around him . He stroked the hens and they responded with delighted clucks , he gobbled with the turkeys and they at once were all attention , he quacked with the ducks , and cackled with a pair of exceedingly flattered geese . The dawn progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be done with his ministrations when quite abruptly something broke his revery . It was a fine broody hen , white , with a maternal eye and a striking abundance of feathers in the under region of the abdomen . The doctor , with the air of a man whose professional interests have found scope , drew Alex ' s attention to those excellences which might otherwise have escaped him : the fine color in comb and wattles , the length and quality of neck and saddle hackles , the firm , wide spread of the toes , and a rare justness in the formation of the ear lappets . All search was ended ; ; he had found his fowl . The purchase was effected and they made their way towards the hotel again , the hen , with whom some sort of communication had been set up , nestling in the doctor ' s arms .	The clocks struck seven-thirty as they approached the hotel entrance ; ; and hopes that the chambermaid and patronne would still be abed began to rise in Alex ' s well exercised breast . The doctor was wearing a long New England greatcoat , hardly necessary in the June weather but a garment which proved well adapted to the sequestration of hens . Alex entered first and was followed by the doctor who , for all his care , manifested a perceptible bulge on his left side where the hen was cradled . They advanced in a line across the entrance hall to the stairway and up , with gingerly steps , towards the first landing . It was then that they heard the tread of one descending and , in some perturbation glancing up , saw the patronne coming towards them as they gained the landing .	`` Bonjour , messieurs , vous etes matinals '' , she greeted them pleasantly . Alex explained that they had been out for a stroll before breakfast while the doctor edged around behind him , attempting to hide the protuberance at his left side behind Alex ' s arm and back .	`` Vous voulez vos petits dejeuners tout de suite alors '' ? ? Their hostess enquired . Alex told her that there was no hurry for their breakfasts , trying at the same time to effect a speedy separation of the persons before and behind him . The doctor , he noticed , was attempting a transverse movement towards the stairs , but before the movement could be completed a distinct and audible cluck ruffled the air in the hollow of the stair-well . Eyes swerved in the patronne ' s head , Alex coughed loudly , and the doctor , with a sforzando of chicken noises floating behind him , took to the stairs in long-shanked leaps .	`` Comment '' ? ? Ejaculated the surprised woman , looking at Alex for an explanation but he , parting from her without ceremony , only offered a few words about the doctor ' s provincial American speech and a state of nerves brought on by the demands of his work . With that he hurried up the stairs , followed by her suspicious gaze .	When Alex entered his room , the doctor was already preparing a nest in the straw case , six eggs ready for the hen ' s attentions . There was no reference to the incident on the stairs , his powers being absorbed by this more immediate business . The hen appeared to have no doubts as to her duties and was quick to settle down to the performance of them . One part of her audience was totally engaged , the connoisseur witnessing a peculiarly fine performance of some ancient classic , the other part , the guest of the connoisseur , attentive as one who must take an intelligent interest in that which he does not fully understand . The spectacle progressed towards a denouement which was obviously still remote ; ; the audience attended . Time elapsed but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an unwelcome knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature . Startled , he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view , and Alex went to the door . He opened it a crack and in doing so made as much shuffling , coughing , and scraping noise as possible in order to drown emanations from the hen who had begun to protest . It was Giselle , the fille de chambre , come to clean the room , and while she stood before him with ears pricked up and regard all curiosity , explaining her errand , Alex could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could to calm the displeased bird . Giselle was reluctant but Alex succeeded in persuading her to come back in five minutes and the door was shut again .	`` Who was that , young feller '' ? ? The doctor instantly asked .	`` That was the fille de chambre , the one you thought couldn ' t get the eggs out . She looked mighty interested , though . Anyhow she ' s coming back in five minutes to do the room '' .	The doctor ' s mind was working at a great speed ; ; he rose to put his greatcoat on and addressed Alex in a muted voice .	`` Have you got our keys handy '' ? ?	`` Right in my pocket '' .	`` All right . Now you go outside and beckon me when it ' s safe '' . The hall was empty and Alex beckoned ; ; they climbed the stairs which creaked , very loudly to their sensitive ears , and reached the next floor . A guest was locking his room ; ; they passed behind him and got to Alex ' s room unnoticed . The doctor sat down rather wearily , caressing the hen and remarking that the city was not the place for a poultry-loving man , but no sooner was the remark out than a knock at this door obliged him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once more . At the door Alex managed to persuade the increasingly astonished fille de chambre to return in ten minutes . It was evident that a second transfer had to be effected , and that it had to take place between the time the fille finished the doctor ' s room and the time she began Alex ' s . They waited three minutes and then crept out on tip-toe ; ; the halls were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine and listened at the door . A bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows being arranged indicated the fille de chambre ' s presence inside ; ; they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced another important fact . The doctor shot down to the lavatory and turned the doorknob , but to no effect : the lavatory was occupied . Although a look of alarm passed over his face , he did not arrest his movements but disappeared into the shower room just as the chambermaid emerged from number nine . Alex suppressed those expressions of relief which offered to prevail in his face and escape from his throat ; ; unwarranted they were in any case for , as he stood facing the fille de chambre , his ears were assailed by new sounds from the interior of the shower room . The events of the last quarter of an hour , mysterious to any bird accustomed only to the predictable life of coop and barnyard , had overcome the doctor ' s hen and she gave out a series of cackly wails , perhaps mourning her nest , but briefly enjoyed . The doctor ' s wits had not left him , however , for all his sixty-eight years , and the wails were almost immediately lost in the sound of water rushing out from the showerhead . Alex nodded to the maid as though nothing unusual were taking place and entered the doctor ' s room . Shortly , the doctor himself entered , his hair somewhat wet from the shower , but evidently satisfied with the outcome of their adventures . Without comment he opened the closet and from its shelves constructed a highboard around the egg case which he had placed on the floor inside . Next , the hen was nested and all seemed well . The two men sat for some time , savoring the pleasure of escape from peril and the relief such escape brings , before they got up and left the hotel , the doctor to go to the conference house and Alex to go to the main post office .	Alex returned to the hotel , rather weary and with no new prospects of a role , in the late afternoon , but found the doctor in an ebullient mood . At the time Alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate communication with the hen , who had settled herself on the nest most peacefully after the occurrences of the morning .	`` Chickens have short memories '' , the doctor remarked , `` that ' s why they are better company than most people I know '' , and he went on to break some important news to Alex .`` Well '' , he began , `` It seems like some people in Paris want to hear more from me than those fellers over at the conference house do . They ' ve got a big vulture from Tanganika at the zoo here , with a wife for him , too , very rare birds , both of them , the only Vulturidae of their species outside Africa . Seems like she ' s willing , but the male just flops around all day like the bashful boy who took Jeannie May behind the barn and then didn ' t know what to do , and the people at the zoo haven ' t got any vulture chicks to show for their trouble .
	Going downstairs with the tray , Winston wished he could have given in to Miss Ada , but he knew better than to do what she said when she had that little-girl look . There were times it wasn ' t right to make a person happy , like the times she came in the kitchen and asked know we don ' t keep peanut `` butter for a peanut butter sandwich . You in this house '' , he always told her .`` Why , Winston '' , she ' d cry , `` I just now saw you eating it out of the jar '' ! ! But he knew how important it was for her to keep her figure .In the kitchen , Leona , his little young wife , was reading the morning paper . Her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool .	`` Here '' , Winston said gently , `` what ' s these dishes doing not washed '' ? ? The enormous plates which had held Mr . Jack ' s four fried eggs and five strips of bacon were still stacked in the sink .	`` Leave me alone '' , Leona said .`` Can ' t you see I ' m busy '' ? ? She looked at him impudently over the corner of the paper .	`` This is moving day '' , Winston reminded her , `` and I bet you left things every which way upstairs , your clothes all over the floor and the bed not made . Leona '' ! ! His eye had fastened on her leg ; ; bending , he touched her knee .`` If I catch you one more time down here without stockings '' -- 	She twitched her leg away .`` Fuss , fuss , old man '' . She had an alley cat ' s manners .	Winston stacked Miss Ada ' s thin pink dishes in the sink . Then he spread out the last list on the counter .`` To Be Left Behind '' was printed at the top in Miss Ada ; ; fine hand . Winston took out a pencil , admired the point , and wrote slowly and heavily , `` Clothes Stand '' .	Sighing , Leona dropped the paper and stood up .`` I guess I better get ready to go '' .	Winston watched her fumbling to untie her apron .`` Here '' . Carefully , he undid the bow .`` How come your bows is always cockeyed '' ? ?	She turned and put her arms around his neck .`` I don ' t want to leave here , Winston '' .	`` Now listen to that '' . He drew back , embarrassed and pleased .`` I thought you was sick to death of this big house . Said you wore yourself out , cleaning all these empty rooms '' .	`` At least there is room here '' , she said .`` What room is there going to be in an apartment for any child '' ? ?	`` I told you what Miss Ada ' s doctor said '' .	`` I don ' t mean Miss Ada ! ! What you think I care about that ? ? I mean our children '' . She sounded as though they already existed .	In spite of the hundred things he had on his mind , Winston went and put his arm around her waist .`` We ' ve got plenty of time to think about that . All the time in the world . We ' ve only been married four years , January '' .	`` Four years '' ! ! She wailed .`` That ' s a long time , waiting '' .	`` How many times have I told you '' -- he began , and was almost glad when she cut him off -- `` Too many times '' ! !-- and flounced to the sink , where she began noisily to wash her hands .	Too many times was the truth of it , Winston thought . He hardly believed his reason himself any more . Although it had seemed a good reason , to begin with : no couple could afford to have children .	`` How you going to work with a child hanging on you '' ? ? He asked Leona .`` You want to keep this job , don ' t you '' ? ? He doubted whether she heard him , over the running water .	He sat for a while with his hands on his knees , watching the bend of her back as she gathered up her things -- a comb , a bottle of aspirin -- to take upstairs and pack . She made him sad some days , and he was never sure why ; ; it was something to do with her back , the thinness of it , and the quick , jerky way she bent . She was too young , that was all ; ; too young and thin and straight .	`` Winston '' ! !	It was Mr . Jack , bellowing out in the hall . Winston hurried through the swinging door .`` I ' ve been bursting my lungs for you '' , Mr . Jack complained . He was standing in front of the mirror , tightening his tie . He had on his gray tweed overcoat and his city hat , and his brief case lay on the bench .`` I don ' t know what you think you ' ve been doing about my clothes '' , he said .`` This coat looks like a rag heap '' .	There were a few blades of lint on the shoulder . Winston took the clothesbrush out of the closet and went to work . He gave Mr . Jack a real going-over ; ; he brushed his shoulders and his back and his collar with long , firm strokes .`` Hey '' ! ! Mr . Jack cried when the brush tipped his hat down over his eyes .	Winston apologized and quickly set the hat right . Then he stood back to look at Mr . Jack , who was pulling on his pigskin gloves . Winston enjoyed seeing him start out ; ; he wore his clothes with style . When he was going to town , nothing was good enough -- he had cursed at Winston once for leaving a fleck of polish on his shoelace . At home , he wouldn ' t even wash his hands for supper , and he wandered around the yard in a pair of sweaty old corduroys . The velvet smoking jackets , pearl-gray , wine , and blue , which Miss Ada had bought him hung brushed and unworn in the closet .	`` Good-by , Winston '' , Mr . Jack said , giving a final set to his hat .`` Look out for those movers '' ! ! Winston watched him hurry down the drive to his car ; ; a handsome , fine-looking man it made him proud to see .After Mr . Jack drove away , Winston went on looking out the window . He noticed a speck of dirt on the sill and swiped at it with his finger . Then he looked at his finger , at the wrinkled , heavy knuckle and the thick nail he used like a knife to pry up , slit , and open . For the first time , he be sad about the move . That house was ten years off his life let himself . Each brass handle and hinge shone for his reward , and he knew how to get at the dust in the china flowers and how to take down the long glass drops which hung from the chandelier . He knew the house like a blind man , through his fingers , and he did not like to think of all the time and rags and polishes he had spent on keeping it up .	Ten years ago , he had come to the house to be interviewed . The tulips and the big pink peonies had been blooming along the drive , and he had walked up from the bus almost singing . Miss Ada had been out back , in a straw hat , planting flowers . She had talked to him right there , with the hot sun in his face , which made him sweat and feel ashamed . Winston had been surprised at her for that . Still , he had liked the way she had looked , in a fresh , neat cotton dress -- citron yellow , if he remembered . She had had a dignity about her , even barefoot and almost too tan .	Since then , the flowers she had planted had spread all over the hill . Already the jonquils were blooming in a flock by the front gate , and the periwinkles were coming on , blue by the porch steps . In a week the hyacinths would spike out . And the dogwood in early May , for Miss Ada ' s alfresco party ; ; and after that the Japanese cherries . Now the yard looked wet and bald , the trees bare under their buds , but in a while Miss Ada ' s flowers would bloom like a marching parade . She had dug a hole for each bulb , each tree wore a tag with her writing on it ; ; where would she go for her gardening now ? ? Somehow Winston didn ' t think she ' d take to window boxes .	Sighing , he hurried to the living room . He had a thousand things to see to . Still , he couldn ' t help thinking , we ' re all getting old , getting small ; ; the snail is pulling in her horns .	In the living room , Miss Ada was standing by the window with a sheaf of lists in her hand . She was looking out at the garden .	`` Winston '' , she said , `` get the basket for the breakables '' .	Winston had the big straw basket ready in the hall . He brought it in and put it down beside her . Miss Ada was looking fine ; ; she had on her Easter suit , blue , with lavender binding . Halfway across the house , he could have smelled her morning perfume . It hung in all her day clothes , sweet and strong ; ; sometimes when he was pressing , Winston raised her dresses to his face .	Frowning , Miss Ada studied the list .`` Well , let ' s see . The china lemon tree . The alabaster cockatoo '' . Winston followed her around the room , collecting the small frail objects ( Christmas , birthday , and anniversary ) and wrapping them in tissue paper . Neither of them trusted the movers .	When they came to Mr . Jack ' s photograph , twenty by twelve inches in a curly silver frame , Miss Ada said , `` By rights I ought to leave that , seeing he won ' t take my clotheshorse '' . She smiled at Winston , and he saw the hateful hard glitter in her eyes . He picked up the photograph and began to wrap it .	`` At least you could leave it for the movers '' , Miss Ada said .`` What possessed you to tell me a clotheshorse would be a good idea '' ? ?	Winston folded the tissue paper carefully .`` He ' s used it every day ; ; every morning , I lay out his clothes on it '' .	`` Well , that ' s over now . And it was his main present ! ! Leave that fool picture out '' , she added sharply .	Winston laid it in the basket .`` Mr . Jack sets store by that '' .	`` Really , Winston . It was meant to be my present '' . But she went on down the list .	Winston was relieved ; ; those presents had been on his mind . He had only agreed with Miss Ada about getting the valet , but he had actually suggested the photograph to Mr . Jack .`` You know what she likes , Winston '' , he had said wearily , one evening in November when Winston was pulling off his overshoes .`` Tell me what to get her for Christmas '' .	`` She ' s been talking about a picture '' , Winston had told him .	`` Picture ! ! You mean picture of me '' ? ? But Winston had persuaded him .	On Christmas night , they had had a disagreement about it . Winston had heard because he was setting up the liquor tray in the next room . Through the door , he had seen Mr . Jack walking around , waiting for Miss Ada . Finally she had come down ; ; Winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown .	`` How do you like it '' ? ? She had asked .	Mr . Jack had said , `` You look about fifteen years old '' .	`` Is that a compliment '' ? ?	`` I don ' t know '' . He had stood at a little distance , studying her , as though he would walk around next and look at the back of her head .	`` Lovie , you make me feel naked '' . Miss Ada had giggled , and she went sweeping and rustling to the couch and sank down .	`` You look like that picture I have at the office '' , Mr . Jack had started .`` Not a line , not a wrinkle . I look like an old man , compared '' , and he had picked up his photograph with the red Christmas bow still on it .`` Look , an old man . Will you wear pink when you ' re sixty '' ? ?	`` Darling , I love that photograph . I ' m going to put it on my dresser '' .	`` I guess it ' s children make a woman old . A man gets old anyhow '' . After a minute he went on , `` People must think the curse is on me , seeing you fresh as an apple and me old and gray '' .	`` I ' ll give you a medical certificate , framed , if you like '' , Miss Ada had said .	`` No . All I want is a picture -- with a few lines . Make the man put them in if he has to '' .	After that they had sat for five minutes without saying a word . Then Miss Ada had stood up , rustling and rustling , and gone upstairs .
Was it love ? ? I had no doubt that it was . During the rest of the summer my scholarly mania for making plaster casts and spatter prints of Catskill flowers and leaves was all but surpassed by the constantly renewed impressions of Jessica that my mind served up to me for contemplation and delight .Nothing in all the preceding years had had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow than the breakup of camp , the packing away of my camp uniforms , the severing of ties with the six or ten people I had grown most to love in the world . In final separation from them , in the railroad terminal across the river from New York , I would nearly cry . My parents ' welcoming arms would seem woeful , inadequate , unwanted . But that year was different , for just as the city , in the form of my street clothes , had intruded upon my mountain nights , so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall : Jessica and I , about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or messhall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs , had agreed to correspond .	These letters became the center of my existence . I lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer . My memory has catalogued for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink , scented stationery and the unsloped , almost printed configurations of her neat , studious handwriting with which she invited me to recall our summer , so many sentences beginning with `` Remember when ; ;'' and others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood , , and news of her commencing again her piano lessons , her private school , a visit to Boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough , wounded , from the war in Europe .	In my letters I took on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real life . Then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques , full of dash and wit and glamor , quoting from the books I read , imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special , after-school class I was enrolled . The letters took their source from a stream of my imagination in which I was transformed into a young man not unlike my bunkmate Eliot Sands -- he of the porch steps anecdotes -- who smoked cigarettes , performed the tango , wore fifty dollar suits , and sneaked off into the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them . Like Eliot , in my fantasies , I had a proud bearing and , with a skill that was vaguely continental , I would lead Jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits , would guide her gently to the night ' s climax which , in my dreams , was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep , moist kisses burning with love . The night after reading her letter about her surgeon uncle -- it must have been late in September -- I had a vision of myself returned in ragged uniform from The Front , nearly dying , my head bandaged and blooded , and Jessica bending over me , the power of her love bringing me back to life . For many nights afterward , the idea of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires , would cause me to lie awake in shame , tossing with irresolution , longing to fall into a deep sleep .	The weeks went by , and the longer our separation grew , the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasies became . They caused my love for Jessica to become warmer and at the same time more hopeless , as if my adolescent self knew that only torment would ever bring me the courage to ask to see her again .	As it turned out , Jessica took matters into her own hands . Having received permission to give a camp reunion-Halloween party , she asked that I come and be her date . I went and , mum and nervous , all but made a fool of myself . Again among those jubilantly reunited bunkmates , I was shy with Jessie and acted as I had during those early Saturday mornings when we all seemed to be playing for effect , to be detached and unconcerned with the girls who were properly our dates but about whom , later , in the privacy of our bunks , we would think in terms of the most elaborate romance . I remember standing in a corner , watching Jessica act the hostess , serving soft drinks to her guests . She was wearing her dark hair in two , thick braids to attain an `` American Girl '' effect she thought was appropriate to Halloween . It made her look sweet and schoolgirlish , I was excited to be with her , but I did not know how to express it . Yet a moment did come that night when the adventurous letter writer and fantasist seemed to stride off my flashy pages , out of my mind , and plant himself in reality . It was late , we were playing kissing games , and Jessica and I were called on to kiss in front of the others . We blushed and were flustered , and it turned out to be the fleetest brush of lips upon cheek . The kiss outraged our friends but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the remote , exciting premonitions of lust , all the mysterious sensations that I had imagined a truly consummated kiss would convey to me .	It was at that party that , finally overcoming my timidity , inspired by tales only half-understood and overheard among older boys , I asked Jessie to spend New Year ' s Eve with me . Lovingly , she accepted , and so great was my emotion that all I could think of saying was , `` You ' re amazing , you know '' ? ? Later , we agreed to think of how we wished to spend that night . We would write to one another and make a definite plan . She was terribly pleased .	Among my school and neighborhood friends , during the next months , I bragged and swaggered and pompously described my impending date . But though I boasted and gave off a dapper front , I was beneath it all frightened . It would be the first time I had ever been completely alone with a girl I loved . I had no idea of what subjects one discussed when alone with a girl , or how one behaved : Should I hold her hand while walking or only when crossing the street ? ? Should I bring along a corsage or send one to her ? ? Was it preferable to meet her at home or in the city ? ? Should I accompany her to the door of her home , or should I ask to be invited in ? ? In or out , should I kiss her goodnight ? ? All this was unknown to me , and yet I had dared to ask her out for the most important night of the year ! !	When in one letter Jessica informed me that her father did not like the idea of her going out alone on New Year ' s Eve , I knew for a moment an immense relief ; ; but the letter went on : she had cried , she had implored , she had been miserable at his refusal , and finally he had relented -- and now how happy she was , how expectant ! !	Her optimism gave me heart . I forced confidence into myself . I made inquiries , I read a book of etiquette . In December I wrote her with authority that we would meet on the steps of the Hotel Astor , a rendezvous spot that I had learned was the most sophisticated . We would attend a film and , later on , I stated , we might go to the Mayflower Coffee Shop or Child ' s or Toffenetti ' s for waffles . I set the hour of our meeting for seven .At five o ' clock that night it was already dark , and behind my closed door I was dressing as carefully as a groom . I wore a new double-breasted brown worsted suit with a faint herringbone design and wide lapels like a devil ' s ears . My camp-made leather wallet , bulky with twisted , raised stitches around the edges , I stuffed with money I had been saving . Hatless , in an overcoat of rough blue wool , I was given a proud farewell by my mother and father , and I set out into the strangely still streets of Brooklyn . I felt superior to the neighborhood friends I was leaving behind , felt older than my years , and was full of compliments for myself as I headed into the subway that was carrying its packs of passengers out of that dull borough and into the unstable , tantalizing excitement of Manhattan .	Times Square , when I ascended to it with my fellow subway travellers ( all dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant members ) , was nearly impassable , the sidewalks swarming with celebrants , with bundled up sailors and soldiers already hugging their girls and their rationed bottles of whiskey . Heavy-coated , severe-looking policemen sat astride noble horses along the curbside to prevent the revellers from spilling out in front of the crawling traffic . The night was cold but the crowd kept one warm . The giant electric signs and marquees were lit up for the first time since blackout regulations had been instituted , and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that victory was just around the corner . Cardboard noisemakers , substitutes for the unavailable tin models , were being hawked and bought at makeshift stands every few yards along Broadway , and one ' s ears were continually serenaded by the horns ' rasps and bleats . An old gentlemen next to me held a Boy Scout bugle to his lips and blasted away at every fourth step and during the interim shouted out , `` V for Victory '' ! ! His neighbors cheered him on . There was a great sense of camaraderie . How did one join them ? ? Where were they all walking to ? ? Was I supposed to buy a funny hat and a rattle for Jessica ? ?	It was a quarter of seven when the crowd washed me up among the other gallants who had established the Astor steps as the beach-head from which to launch their night of merrymaking . I looked over their faces and felt a twinge : they all looked so much more knowing than I . I looked away . I looked for Jessica to materialize out of the clogging , curdling crowd and , as the time passed and I waited , a fiend came to life beside me and whispered in my ear : How was I planning to greet Jessica ? ? Where exactly would we go after the movie ? ? Suppose the lines in front of the movie houses were too long and we couldn ' t get in ? ? Suppose I hadn ' t brought along enough money ? ? I felt for my wallet . Its thick , substantial outline calmed me .	But when I saw that it was already ten past seven , I began to wonder if something had gone wrong . Suppose her father had changed his mind and had refused to let her leave ? ? Suppose at this very moment her father was calling my house in an effort to cancel the plans ? ? I grew uneasy . All about me there was a hectic interplay of meetings taking place , like abrupt , jerky scenes in old silent movies , joyous greetings and beginnings , huggings and kissings , enthusiastic forays into the festive night . Whole platoons were taking up new positions on the steps , arriving and departing , while I stayed glued , like a signpost , to one spot .	At 7 : 25 two hotel doormen came thumping down the steps , carrying a saw-horse to be set up as a barricade in front of the haberdashery store window next to the entranceway , and as I watched them in their gaudy red coats that nearly scraped the ground , their golden , fringed epaulets and spic , red-visored caps , I suddenly saw just over their shoulders Jessica gracefully making her way through the crowd . My heart almost stopped beating .
	They were west of the Sabine , but only God knew where .	For three days , their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead sea . Molten glare singed their eyelids an angry crimson ; ; suffocating air sapped their strength and strained their nerves to snapping ; ; dust choked their throats and lay like acid in their lungs . And the valley stretched endlessly out ahead , scorched and baked and writhing in its heat , until it vanished into the throbbing wall of fiery orange brown haze .	Ben Prime extended his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the noses of the oxen .`` Hoa-whup '' ! ! He commanded from his raw throat , and felt the pain of movement in his cracked , black burned lips .	He removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through the dust film upon his gaunt face . He spat . The dust-thick saliva came from his mouth like balled cotton . He moved back to the wheel and stood there blowing , grasping the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his played-out limbs . The burning air dried his sweat-soaked clothes in salt-edged patches .	He cleared his throat and wet his lips . As cheerfully as possible , he said , `` Well , I guess we could all do with a little drink '' .	He unlashed the dipper and drew water from a barrel . They could no longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat bag that cooled it by evaporation . The water was warm and stale and had a brackish taste . But it was water . Thank the Lord , they still had water ! !	He cleansed his mouth with a small quantity . He took a long but carefully controlled draught . He replenished the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck . She took it grudgingly , her dark eyes baleful as they met his .	She drank and pushed back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and wipe her face . She set the dipper on the edge of the deck , leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully .	`` What happens when there ' s no more water '' ? ? She asked smolderingly .	She was like charcoal , he thought -- dark , opaque , explosive . Her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal . Her temper sparked like charcoal when it first lights up . And all the time , she had the heat of hatred in her , like charcoal that is burning on its under side , but not visibly .	A ripple ran through the muscles of his jaws , but he kept control upon his voice .	`` There must be some water under there '' . He tilted his homely face toward the dry bed of the river .`` We can get it if we dig '' , he said patiently .	`` And add fever to our troubles '' ? ? She scoffed .`` Or do you want to see if I can stand fever , too '' ? ?	`` We can boil it '' , he said .	Her chin sharpened .`` We ' re lost and burning up already '' , she bit out tensely .`` The tires are rattling on the wheels now . They ' ll roll off in another day . There was no valley like this on your map . You don ' t even know where we ' re headed '' .	`` Hettie '' , he said as gently as he could , `` we ' re still headed west . Somewhere , we ' ll hit a trail '' .	`` Somewhere ! !'' She repeated .`` Maybe in time to make a cross and dig our graves '' .	His wide mouth compressed . In a way , he couldn ' t blame her . He had picked out this pathless trail , instead of the common one , in a moment of romantic fancy , to give them privacy on their honeymoon .	It had been a mistake , but anything would have been a mistake , as it turned out . It wasn ' t the roughness and crudity and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her . She had hated the whole idea before they started . Actually , she had hated him before she ever saw him . It had been five days too late before he learned that she ' d gone through the wedding ceremony in a semitrance of laudanum , administered by her mother .	The bitterness of their wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound . She had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder . He had left her inviolate , thinking familiarity would gentle her in time . But each mile westward , she had hated him the deeper .	He stared at the dipper , turning it over and over in his wide , calloused hands .`` I suppose '' , he muttered , `` I can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folks , once we find a settlement '' .	`` Don ' t try to be noble '' ! ! Her laugh was hard .`` They wouldn ' t have sold me in the first place if there ' d been food enough to go around '' .	He winced .`` Hettie , they didn ' t sell you '' , he said miserably .`` They knew I was a good sharecrop farmer back in Carolina , but out West was a chance to build a real farm of our own . They thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what ' s inside of them . Without money or property , what would you have had at Baton Rouge '' ? ?	`` I might have starved , but at least I wouldn ' t be fried to a crisp and soaked with dirt '' ! !	He darkened under his heavy burn . His blue eyes sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead .	To his puzzlement , there suddenly was no haze . The valley lay clear , and open to the eye , right up to the sharp-limbed line of gaunt , scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead .Then he noticed the clouds racing upon them -- heavy , ominous , leaden clouds that formed even as they sliced over the crests of the surrounding hills . He had never seen clouds like them before , but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a hurricane in Carolina .	He hollered hoarsely , `` Hang on '' ! ! And goaded the oxen as he yelled . He wanted to turn them , putting the wagon against the storm . Too late , he realized that in turning , he had wheeled them onto a patch of sandy ground , instead of atop a grade or ridge .	He swung up over the wheel .`` You had better get inside '' , he warned her .	But she sat on in stubborn silence .	The clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel . Frozen , they stared at it whirling down the valley , gouging and spitting out boulders and chunks of earth like a starving hound dog cracking marrowbones . The six-ton Conestoga began to whip and shake .	Their world turned black . It was filled with dust and wind and sound and violence . The heavens opened , pelting them with hail the size of walnuts . And then came the water -- not rain , but solid sheets that sluiced down like water slopping from a bucket . Walls of water rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like the crests of flash floods . Through the splash of the rising waters , they could hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon , gnashing big chunks out of the banks .	The jetting , frothing surface of the river reached the level of the runoff . The dangerous current upon the prairie ceased , but the water stood and kept on rising . They cringed under sodden covers , listening to the waves slop against the bottom .	The cloudburst cut off abruptly . They were engulfed by the weird silence , broken only by the low , angry murmur of the river . Then the darkness thinned , and there was light again , and then bright sunlight .	Beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill , they crawled to the hurricane deck and looked out haggardly at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding hills . The water level was higher than their hubs . Only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored .	There was no real sign of the river now , just a roiling , oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere . Clumps of brush rode down the ribbon . Now and then , the glistening side of a half-swamped object showed as it swept past .	The girl crawled out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine , hugging her shoulders and still trembling . Her face was pale but set and her dark eyes smoldered with blame for Ben .	Out of compulsion to say something cheery , Ben Prime blurted , `` Well , we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first floodheads hit . At least , the wheels dug in . The soaking will put life back in the wagon , too '' .	His wife didn ' t give a sign she ' d heard . She was watching a tree ride wildly down that roiling current . Somebody was riding the tree . It raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair , sitting astride an upright branch .	She did not call out . But as the tree passed , she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell . They watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend . It speared up into the air , then sinking back , the up-jutting branch turned slowly . The pale blob of the woman disappeared .	`` There ' s the one who ' s lucky '' ! ! The girl murmured harshly .	Ben ' s eyes strained with the bitter hurt , his homely face slashed with gray and crimson . Then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk with the beasts , needing their comfort more than they needed his .	It was nearly sundown and he went to the back of the wagon , half-swimming his way , for he was not a tall man . He let down the tailgate and was knocked over by the sluice of water .	He sputtered back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of seed grain forward . They were already swollen to bursting . Of all their worldly belongings , next to the oxen and his gun , the seed grain had been the most treasured . It was spoiled now for seed , and it would sour and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry it . The oxen might as well enjoy it .	He examined the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished . The waters lay muddy but placid , without a ripple of movement against the wheels ; ; there was not a match-width of damp mark to show they were receding .	He doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate , dry hills that rimmed the valley . A terrible , numbing sense of futility swept over him .	He gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat . Then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen . The spokes were tight again , the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece .	Hope surged within him . He swung toward the front to give the news to Hettie , then stopped , barred from her by the vehemence of her blame and hate . Still , he felt better . A tight wagon meant so much .He got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee . He poured the water off the sourdough and off the flour , salvaging the chunky , watery messes for biscuits of a sort . Their jams and jellies had not suffered . He found a jar of preserved tomatoes and one of eggs that they had meant to save . Now he broke them open , hoping a good meal might lessen this depression crushing Hettie .	His long nose wiggled at the smells of frizzling bacon and heating java , but the fire was low , and he wanted to waste no time . He furled the slashed sides of the canvas tarpaulins , leaving the ribs and wagon open .	He looked thoughtfully at his wife ' s trunk , holding her meager treasures . He said hesitantly , `` Hettie , I don ' t figure your things got wet too much . That ' s a good trunk . If you want to get them aired '' 	She said without turning her head , `` After that rain beating in atop the dust , there isn ' t a thing that won ' t be streaked '' .	He drew a long breath and opened the trunk and hung out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs .
	Sulphur , oil , and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dreams of . I suppose a Lascar sailor had sneaked a cigarette in the hold and touched off the blaze . Now , roaring up in great oily clouds of smoke and flames , the fierce heat quickly drove us to the stern where we huddled like suffocating sheep , not knowing what to do .	The lifeboats were stuck fast . We couldn ' t budge them . I heard a cry from a stoker as a pillar of flame leaped from a hatch and tongued the man ' s bare back . He sprinted to the rail and leaped overboard into the shark-infested waters .	One especially bad detonation shook Lifeboat No . 3 which trembled violently in the davits . Brassnose yelled : `` Come on , Sommers , Max step on it , we got a chance now . Heave on those ropes ; ; the boat ' s come unstuck '' .	We pulled and swore and yanked and wept , scraping our hands until they bled profusely . The Bonaventure was quivering and lurching like an old spavined mare . Her stern was down and a sharp list helped us to cut loose the lifeboat which dropped heavily into the water .	Brassnose , Max and I leaped into the sea and swam to the boat .`` Let ' s get away fast '' , said Brassnose , shaking water from his mop of bleached hair .`` That tub is going to explode all at once '' .	Then the Bonaventure seemed to disintegrate with a roar of live steam , geysers of sparks and flames , and a dense cloud of black-and-orange smoke . Dimly , we heard the voices of men in mortal agony but we couldn ' t go back into that inferno .	Already our leaky lifeboat was filled with five inches of water .`` Sommers , you bale while we row '' , Brassnose commanded .	As best as I could determine , we were some 700 miles west of New Guinea , in the Bismark Archipelago . Three days previously , we had steamed past barren Rennell Island in the distance . Now we peered anxiously for any speck of land in the Pacific , for this interminable bailing would have to stop soon . There were gigantic blisters and rope burns on our hands ; ; our muscles were hot wires of pain .	Brassnose was strangely silent . The big man with the whitened hair murmured something : his words sounded as if they were in the Manu tongue , which I recognized , having studied the dialect in my Anthropology 6 , class at the University of Chicago .	He then said something which struck a chord in my memory .	`` God help us if we ' re near the island of Eromonga . We ' d be in real trouble then . I ' d rather keep bailing -- or sink '' .	I was puzzled by the remark , then I recalled the voice of mild Professor Howard Griggs three years ago in a university lecture on primitive societies . He had been speaking of this archipelago : 	`` Even when the islands were under German mandate before World War 1 , , Europeans gave Eromonga a wide berth . The place is inhabited by several hundred warlike women who are anachronisms of the Twentieth Century -- stone age amazons who live in an all-female , matriarchal society which is self-sufficient '' .	I remembered , too , the jesting voice of a classmate , Bobby Pauson : `` But how do they reproduce , Dr . Griggs ? ? I ' m sure that males have something to do with that process '' ! !	There had been classroom guffaws which quickly subsided as Professor Griggs said dryly : `` I see your point , Pauson . Of course , males play a role there , but believe me when I say you wouldn ' t enjoy yourself one bit on Eromonga . Indeed , you wouldn ' t live long , for the females either drive the men they ' ve seized from neighboring islands back to their boats after exploiting them for amatory purposes , or they destroy them by revolting but ingenious methods . In fact , one important aspect of their very religion is the annihilation of men '' .	`` I think I know what you mean , Brassnose '' , I said .`` I know something about Eromonga . Let ' s hope we come to a safer place '' .	But we didn ' t . Three hours later , while we were bailing desperately , a dot of land came into view . Foster Lukuklu Frayne made a sign over his heart with his two linked thumbs : I recognized it as an ancient Manu gesture intended to propitiate the Devil .	A half-hour passed ; ; we had drifted closer . In a voice so frightened as to seem not his own , the big bo ' sun ' s mate quavered : 	`` Tchalo ! ! It is Eromonga -- look hard , you can see with your naked eye the wooden scaffolding on the cliff '' .	I squinted at the looming shoreline . There was a wooden tower or derrick there , something like a ski jump ; ; it was perhaps 80 feet high and had been artfully constructed of logs . A fine example of engineering in a primitive society .	`` What is the scaffolding for , Brassnose '' ? ?	He made a sound of despair deep in his throat . It was embarrassing to see strapping , blonde Brassnose comport himself like a child who talks about bogeymen .	`` Aaa-ee ! ! It is their tultul , the ' jumping platform ' of death . It is the last of the three tests of manhood which the women impose , to discover if a male is worthy of survival there . Often , I heard my uncles and cousins speak of it when I was a small boy growing up in Rabaul . They had never seen a tultul but they had heard about it from their fathers '' .	Our lifeboat was filling rapidly and despite what I had heard of the inhabitants of Eromonga , I was glad to see a long and graceful outrigger manned by three bronzed girls glide out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward our craft .	I expected Brassnose -- as a man with a strain of Melanesian in his blood -- to speak to them . But he had turned a sickly green and appeared tongue-tied or panicked .	So , I mustered my few words of the Manu dialect and said , `` We greet you in peace . In ngandlu . My friends and I come from a ship which was destroyed by fire . We are thirsty and hungry ; ; our sore and burned hands and arms need attention '' .	The girl in the prow of the outrigger turned a smile like a beacon on me . I noted that her full breasts were bare and that she wore a garland of red pandanus fruit in her blue-black hair .	She said , `` My name is Songau and these girls are Ponkob and Piwen . You are welcome to Eromonga . My people await you on the shore . You shall have food , water and rest '' .	Thirty minutes later , the outrigger grated on sand and other girls , waiting on shore , rushed forward to pull it up on the beach and make it fast with vine ropes to a large boulder . I saw a dozen or so other outriggers moored there .	I looked . All my rosy visions of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished at the sight . There was a mound of bleached human bones and skulls at the base of the big wooden derrick . Some had been there for years ; ; others still had whitened shreds of decayed flesh sticking to them .	There was one object which sickened yet fascinated me . This was also a corpse -- a male , judging from the coral arm bands , the tribal scars still discernible on the maggoty face , the painted bone of the warrior caste which still pierced the septum of the rotting nose .	The body may have been two or three weeks ' dead . I looked with revulsion at the legs . They were shattered . Many small bones protruded crazily from the shreds of flesh . The man must have leaped to his death from the topmost rung of the tultul .	As if divining my thoughts , the girl Songau smiled warmly and said in the casual tone an American woman might use in describing her rose garden : 	`` This is our tultul , a jumping platform , aku . Later , you shall know it better . Is it not well-made ? ? Our old one blew down in a storm at the time of the pokeneu festival fifteen moons ago . It took thirty of our women almost six moons to build this one , which is higher and stronger than the old one . We are very proud of it '' .	`` You have every right to be '' , I replied gravely in the Manu dialect , but my attention was fixed on Brassnose , the biggest and strongest of us . He looked as if he was going to keel over . I felt a queasiness in my own stomach but it wouldn ' t do to show these girls that we were afraid . Not so soon , anyway .	I clapped the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily , hoping it would make an impression on the women : `` This one is the maku Frayne . He speaks your language too , for he is the grandson of a chieftain on Taui who made much magic and was strong and cunning . The maku Frayne has inherited this strength from his grandfather '' .	This was the worst thing I could have said . Brassnose turned a stricken face toward me and said brokenly , `` Sommers , you meddling Yank , you ' re a fool ! ! They despise males who brag of their strength ; ; they destroy such men with their damned tests . You ' ve ruined me , blast you '' ! !	At first , I thought he was out of his head , talking wildly like this . But a glance at Songau and the other women confirmed what Brassnose had blurted out .	The women ' s faces had hardened after my statement . At a nod from Songau , four lithe and muscular girls darted to Frayne ' s side and seized him by the arms . The man was an ox and he put up a creditable struggle ; ; but four Eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest male that ever lived .	Besides , terror had sapped some of Frayne ' s vitality and will . My last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face 	. In the Manu tongue , `` eromonga '' means manhood -- a quality which the women derisively toasted in weekly feasts at which great quantities of a brew like kava were imbibed . In the hut to which I was assigned -- Max had his own quarters -- my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping breasts who seemed to enjoy conversing with me in rudimentary phrases .	Her name was L ' Turu and she told me many things . For an anthropologist , loquacious old L ' Turu was a mine of information . Though I had a great dread of the island and felt I would never leave it alive , I eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women .( Her account was later confirmed by the Scobee-Frazier Expedition from the University of Manitoba in 1951 .) 	From L ' Turu , I heard that until about 1850 the people of this island -- which was about the size of Guam or smaller -- had been of both sexes , and that the normal family life of Melanesian tribes was observed here with minor variations .	But in the middle of the last century an island woman named `` Karipo '' seized a spear in the heat of an inter-tribal battle and rallied the women after their men had fled . Miraculously , Karipo and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred invaders from the isle of Pamasu back to their war canoes , after considerable loss of life on both sides .	Karipo was something of a politician as well as a militarist . She quickly exploited the exalted position she now occupied , by harassing the disorganized males and even putting many of them to death . Within a decade or less , few men were left and a feminist society had sprung up .	`` Karipo was great goddess , told our mothers that men were not necessary except to father children '' , the crone told me .`` All men went away from here . Those who stayed had to pass tests . Few passed '' . She cackled with mirth , showing the stumps of betel-stained teeth .`` Karipo ' s women then named this place ' Eromonga ' -- manhood -- for just the strongest men could stay here . Come , I show you '' .	The old woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood . In the shade of a palm tree in front of the squalid dwelling I saw four figures in a semi-circle on the ground .
	`` I guess he spent the morning getting himself all organized , then headed for home . Maybe to beat up on his squaw '' . Benson looked up and saw Ramey ' s long head tilt forward to rub his chin on the stiff edge of the overall bib . Ramey reached out with the tire iron and dislodged a chunk of mud that was caked on the spare tire rack .	`` I ' d like to know just which it is that those guys don ' t understand , the liquor or automobiles '' . Somehow the thought of a simple man bewildered by things no one had ever really helped him understand moved the driver . For a moment his hatred toward drunken or careless drivers softened . Maybe the Indian wasn ' t too much at fault , Ramey thought . Maybe he was only doing the best he knew how , like any of us . Anyway , he doesn ' t deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at .	`` Ever see yourself spread out on the pavement , Benny '' ? ? He said to his partner .	`` You mean dream '' ? ?	`` Not exactly . Just see it '' . Benson grinned and flipped a rock with his thumb like a marble .	`` Nope , just you , all the time -- sometimes I think it ' s the only way I ' ll ever get a decent partner '' .	Ramey smiled but he thought to himself , I always see me too . Never Benny . Whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt , Ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind . Then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think . With this realization , sometimes , he saw himself as he looked down .	`` You seen him yet '' ? ? Benson said , referring to the Indian .	`` He wasn ' t in the car '' , Ramey said .	`` You didn ' t go clear around '' , Benson said .`` If you want to see something , he ' s back on the other side by the trunk of the car '' .	`` Too long a waiting line '' , Ramey answered , pretending to joke .	A few minutes later the insurance man , a road checker , drove up in the gray coupe with license plates on it from a far-away state . It was a trick they used to try and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their speed . Sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as they passed . All the drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with shredded edges , the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out joyfully chopping cane . Horsely , an agent on the east end , wore the hat , trying to look like a tourist . It had always seemed strange to Ramey that to disguise himself as a tourist , an ex-truck driver like Horsely would merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head .	The insurance man informed them that he had talked to Crumley who was all right and that he would watch the men ' s personal effects until they towed the rig back to town . He chatted with Ramey and Benson for a minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer . Every so often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear .	When they were ready to leave , Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer .	`` There ' s a body you won ' t mind looking at '' , Benson said and they stopped . She had driven up with her husband in a convertible with Eastern license plates , although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that . She wore shorts and a loose terry-cloth shirt . Slender and tanned , her dark brown hair was drawn straight back , simply .	`` What outfit does she drive for '' ? ? Benson said .	Seeing her caused a lurch in Ramey , a recognition . She might have been someone he had once loved . He had never seen her before , but now he thought of the manner in which he and Benson went in and out of the cities , at each end of their run . The truck routes , the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed briefly through his mind -- back alleys were their access to a city and they could never stay . How would you ever see her again ? ? The feeling subsided , it was only a small yearning . Their work was lonely .	`` What ' s she doing in this bunch '' ? ? Benson said , and Ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been .	The girl looked around at the countryside . Her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing . It made only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on . She began to watch a blonde-haired man , also in shorts , standing right at the rear of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured slightly . What had caught his attention was obscured by the car itself , so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see , but Benson knew what it was . The girl took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when Benson , in that barefoot courtliness Ramey could never decide was real , said , `` You don ' t want to go around there , Ma ' am '' . The girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her .	The man stood near the bent levi-clad body of the Indian who lay face down almost under the car . The two drivers moved closer .	`` What does he want , a spoon '' ? ? Benson said to Ramey .	One tiny detail in a happening can clog the memory and stick like meat in a crooked tooth , while the rest of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain . With Ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was half-off the Indian ' s foot that he would always remember . The laces were broken at the bottom of the eyelets but there was still a bow knot at the top . The slightest twitch would have parted the shoe entirely from the foot , yet the toes were still inside .	The two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed man . He wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red V at the neck , the sleeves pushed above the elbows . He turned and looked at them with clear blue eyes , immaculate eyes . He was very tanned -- big hands might have torn him from a Coca-Cola poster .	`` He ' s dead , isn ' t he '' ? ? The man said . He turned and bent over the body of the Indian . There was nothing in particular on the man ' s face . It was simply a matter of curiosity , a natural right to examine .	`` What ' s this '' ? ? The man said , backing up a step , still looking down . His words were mostly to himself .	`` Don ' t '' . There was a gentle concern in Benson ' s voice . Ramey looked down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man ' s tanned leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded , blood-flecked substance lying by itself on the pavement .	`` But what is it '' ? ? The man said with a tone of impatience .	But what is it ? ? The man had spoken only once . Ramey heard the words again inside , weakened , the way moving water sounds through a grove of trees , until he was not sure whether it was sound or light-headedness pressing in his ears .	The sneaker reached out once more to tap against the mass and Ramey ' s vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the man ' s leg . Ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown skin . He stared at the shining , shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees , `` Don ' t do that , fella . Them ' s brains '' .	The man seemed to sink a little as Ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again , with his fist . Ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth . It was a straight , solid , once-in-a-lifetime shot ; ; he laid all four knuckles in between the man ' s cheekbone and his chin . Ramey ' s fist and the air expelled from the man ' s collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like cupped hands clapping together .	The man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement . Ramey heard a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand . As he watched the man sit suddenly , a detached part of his mind observed how very difficult it was , really , to knock a man off his feet . He hadn ' t done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard .	With a thoughtful look , the man sat on the pavement , legs straight out in front of him . His arms hung like empty shirt sleeves , and his mouth was slightly open . After what seemed several seconds , the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it . The man brought one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he touched his mouth . He moaned and pulled the hand away . Even yet there was no realization in his eyes .	Ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him . He did not look around .	`` What happened '' ? ? Someone said .	`` He ' s hurt '' ! ! A woman ' s voice said , and then he heard a sort of wail from the man ' s wife . The man on the ground began to move ; ; one of his hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him . Blood dripped down the front of his sweater , soaking into a dark streak of dirt that ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder , as though the bright V woven into the neckline had melted , running a darker color .	The girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back .`` Can you hear , can you talk to me '' ? ? She begged . An incoherent , puzzled sound came from the red mouth . The girl looked around quickly at several of the people . None of the crowd had stepped forward to help . Then she saw Ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment .	`` Why did you do it -- why did you hit him '' ? ? She said , her voice rising . Ramey said nothing . A shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again .	Behind Ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers . No one seemed to know for sure what had happened , nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver , beyond finding out .	Ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman . Benson moved his arms , gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly . Ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man . Some of the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey . It ' s all over now , the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them . Ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer . He saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman ' s swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and rolled at the side of his stocky body , the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of his pistol .	`` All right , step back '' ! ! The patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis . He walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him .	`` You all right '' ? ?	`` Mough -- it ' s my mough '' , the man said , trying to talk without moving his lips . His brown face looked gray from dirt streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it .
Then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the venomous head -- caught in the wicker back of the chair , the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the brute . The body continued to lash , but now Keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome , bloody mass out of the bungalow . He slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up , alarmed at the sound of the shots . He heard their chattering , and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered the snake right on the porch with wood axes .	It was only then that he turned to look at Penny .	She was sitting on the edge of the bed again , back in the same position where the snake had found her . The fear had not entirely gone from her face , but there were some other emotions now , crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth .	But her hands were calm , now . She ' s got guts , thought Keith . She ' s got more guts than any other woman in the world .	`` Keith '' , said Penny , `` Keith , you were wonderful . I don ' t suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life , but I am . Thank you , Keith '' .	He smiled at her sincerity . And for the hundredth time that week , he was startled at her beauty . Strange . Seven years they ' d been married . He knew her mind pretty well , by now , its quick perceptions and sympathies , its painful insistence on truth and directness , its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to reciprocate , even in part . But her beauty always surprised him anew .	`` I realize that this is hardly the time to say it , Penny '' , said Keith .`` But knowing you , I know that you ' re glad to be alive , and grateful -- and sorry because I killed the snake , even though I had to . Isn ' t that so '' ? ?	Penny lowered her eyes .	`` Yes '' , she said , almost in a whisper , as if admitting to a crime .	`` The snake was beautiful , wasn ' t it '' ? ? Asked Keith , his voice getting harsher in spite of himself , as he struggled to control his growing anger .`` It was a king cobra , the largest you ever saw , and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle , didn ' t it ? ? didn ' t it ? ?'' 	Penny did not answer . Now , she just sat there looking at him , without an expression except concern for him .	`` We ' re all God ' s creatures , aren ' t we '' ? ? Keith was snarling now .`` All of us -- every goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle . You love this village and these stinking brown people because they ' re God ' s creatures , too . And you love Ahmiri , that black bastard of a servant even a little more , because he ' s a beautiful man . And he loves you because you ' re a beautiful woman . We ' re all God ' s creatures , aren ' t we , Penny ? ? All of us , that is , except me . You hate me , you hate my guts , because I like to hunt . You actually hate me -- and we both know it -- because I killed that filthy snake . Well , why don ' t you say something '' ? ?	Penny would not rise to his mood .	`` There isn ' t anything left to say , is there , Keith '' ? ?	She softly let herself into the bed , and took her regular side , away from the door , where she slept better because Keith was between her and the invader . He knew she was not sulking , not even angry at him . Just as he knew that she had stopped loving him .	The Brahmaputra has its headwaters in the tableland of the world , the towering white headwalls of the Himalayas that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet . For a brief period each year , the rays of the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the headwalls , and then the pinnacles glisten in the daytime at high noon , and billions of gallons of water begin their slow seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys on their long , meandering journey to the sea -- running east past the sky-carving massifs of Gurla Mandhata and Kemchenjunga , then turning south and curling down through the jungles of Assam , past the Khasi Hills , and into Bengal , past Sirinjani and Madaripur , until the hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the Bay of Bengal .	Keith Sterling had looked down on the Brahmaputra more times than he could remember , during the war days when he flew over the Hump of the world , thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space . But Keith looked down more than up . He thought of the jungles below him , and of the wild , strange , untracked beauty there and he promised himself that someday he would return , on foot perhaps , to hunt in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted , and animals the lords .	At first it had been just a romantic dream of his , the same as the idea of finishing Oxford after the war . But `` after the war '' was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself . Wing Commanders in the RAF do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes , to their men or to themselves . And Keith ' s record of kills made him a man to listen to -- a man paradoxically , who might even survive . He became a fighter pilot after the stint over the Hump in the big crates . The RAF was Britain ' s weapon of attrition , and flying a fighter plane was the way her sons could serve her best at this point in the war .	He knew how to shoot down Nazis . And he knew that the men talked about him behind his back , saying that he was one up on everybody else -- including the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it -- because he was chemically incapable of fear . That was true , but only half the truth . The other half he didn ' t like to recognize , even to himself . He enjoyed the killing . Not defending England , or being an ace , or fighting for humanity . He enjoyed killing . And he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a Nazi .	Nowadays , we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish . The Nazis bombed Britain , so the RAF retaliated and shot them all down . Not quite . It was a war of nerves , of stamina , of dogged endurance in which the stupid insistence of the British on their right to their own country became ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the Nazis , who were better organized and technically superior . It took a long time before the British tipped the balance .	Keith learned too much about air combat , and air killing , to be risked . They grounded him ( over his protests -- not including his true reason for wanting to fly ) and put him in the Command offices .	That was where he met Penny .	He was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking American WAC , a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work , ( regardless of how important she might have thought she was ) in the Command offices , but that was all . Penny knew him better , on her part . He had a war reputation , but this was the kind of man women like even without medals . They don ' t go for bull-like muscle , as a rule . He had strength in his six-foot frame , but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier . He was on the thin side , with big hands , and the kind of wrists that give away the power in forearm and bicep .	His hair was black , already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom , the only one permitted to a man . The pretty little twittering WACS said he had the look of eagles -- and Penny , hating the cliche , had to admit that in this case it applied . Keith was an eagle .	Penny and Keith had no romance . No dates or hand-holding . But they met in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly .	The Command offices were in the border country , up north , where the radar systems centralized their intelligence reports , and the fighters were dispatched to harry the enemy . The Nazis knew this , of course , and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers , they let a few drop every time they went over , hoping for a lucky hit .	This time , they had been lucky . The Command post was underground , and well camouflaged . But there hadn ' t been enough time to build it for keeps . There was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling , but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer , if as efficacious , when a direct hit comes along .	This one was actually more of a `` near miss '' . The bomb plunged into the ground near the Post , but not precisely into the Command room itself . There was a shattering , cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle , the air filled with dust and flying debris , and everyone in the room -- men and women hit the floor and used the desks as turtlebacks , as ordered .	That is , everyone but Keith and Penny .	They stood there , just the two of them , in the rocking , shattering blast . Keith was on his feet because he didn ' t care at all about life any more : Penny on her feet , proudly , because she cared too much .	The bomb was a solitary one . The blast damaged , but did not destroy the room . Keith ' s eyes met Penny ' s as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction . And , as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks and tend to those wounded , and mark the several killed , he climbed across the debris to Penny and took her hand in his .	The chaplain married them , on the next day .	After the war , Penny had wanted Keith at least to visit her home with her . She came from Ohio , from what she called a `` small farm '' of two hundred acres , as indeed it was to farmer-type farmers . But to Keith ' s London-bred mind , such acreage sounded rather invincible . It wasn ' t that , however , which decided them not to go to America . Keith told Penny about his dream to return to India and Burma . He stressed the wild beauty of the mountains , and the jungles . He didn ' t tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself . He couldn ' t stop killing . That was his true love , not Penny . The terrible power of a gun , the thing that blasted the soul out of a living body , man or beast , was one he never wanted to lose . And in the hunting land , this hunger was considered to be a noble thing .	When they got to Shillong , in Assam , he was happy . This is a paradise for hunters . This was the land of the sladang , the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread . The great black leopards . The sambur buck , the jungle stag that is even more noble than the Scottish elk . He even hunted elephant , although the Asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his African cousin . But there are big rogues in both countries . These were the ones Keith sought out -- the loners , the ones who killed for the joy of it , like himself .	He and Penny would go out on tame elephants , raised from babyhood in the keddah . And while he was ever alert for game , and most particularly a tiger , Penny marvelled at the Eden they were traversing . They came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools . Peacocks strutted across their path , preening . There were fantastic flowers without perfume , and gaudy birds without song . Mouse deer played around the feet of the elephants , or fled when the mighty legs thrashed too close . Wild boar watched their progress with little pig eyes , and grunted derision when they didn ' t consider such game worthy of a shot from the .
Now , the next morning , they were anchored at The Elbow and the boat was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down 600 fathoms , with the weighted line beside it ; ; and Robinson Roy , who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive , was already back on the surface .	He and his safety man , Herr Schaffner , swam up to the boarding ladder together . The German courteously indicated that Robinson should mount first . Robinson clambered heavily into the boat , sat down , and stripped off his triple-tank assembly . He was frowning . He took his mask from his forehead and threw it , unexpectedly , across the deck .	`` Temper , temper '' , Mrs . Forsythe said , laughing uneasily . A phony blonde hanging onto a bygone youth and beauty , but irreparably stringy in the neck , she was already working on her second gin and tonic , though it was not yet ten A . M . 	`` I loused it '' , Rob said , with a savage note in his voice .`` All I have to do to set the record is to go on down . So instead I come up '' .	`` Was it my equipment '' ? ? The German asked .`` Was it something went bad with the breathing '' ? ?	`` The equipment was fine '' , Rob stated , standing up . He was a huge young man of twenty-four , clothed in muscle , immensely strong , with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that was submerged under his present agitation . He stared stonily at the floor .`` I was down to 275 . I ' ve been that far half a dozen times . I don ' t get it why this time I should pull such a stupid trick '' .	`` Well , I get it '' , Artie said , still on the ladder .`` You are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting a record . And you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that tells you to turn around before you drown yourself . So you turn around '' .	`` No , it wasn ' t that '' , Rob said . A note of awe came into his voice .`` When I came up , damnit , I thought I was going down . I came up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was happening '' .	`` Pressure-happy '' , Artie said , and climbed in .	`` That ' s right '' , Robinson said .`` I was expecting it , sure . But when it happens to you like that , I tell you , and you ' re a hundred feet from where you thought you were -- well , it makes you think . You don ' t head back down again . Not me , anyway . Not right away '' . He had his voice under control again : no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him .	Waddell , the newspaperman , was a fellow in his middle forties , with a graying crewcut , heavy-framed glasses , and a large jaw padded with fat . Now he was going to show how much he knew .`` Our boy didn ' t chicken out , no sir . He ran into the rapture of the depths . Nitrogen narcosis . It makes the diver feel drunk '' .	`` Well , that ' s the only way to be '' , Mrs . Forsythe said , and gave her brassy laugh .	`` Maybe not , if you ' re 200 feet under water '' , Artie said .	`` Anyway '' , Waddell went on .`` It ' s nothing to fool with . It can kill you . Personally , I don ' t blame him for giving up the dive , much as I regret losing the story '' .	`` Nobody ' s giving anything up '' , Robinson said . He stood there , towering over them all : gentle , mighty , determined , the moving force in the group ; ; and yet like a child among adults .`` You think I got you and Artie and Herr Schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride ? ? I ' m going down again '' .	`` That ' s my boy '' ! ! Mr . Forsythe exclaimed .`` Rob ' s not going to give up as easy as all that '' . He was a florid , puffy man in his early sixties , very natty in his yachting cap , striped jacket and white flannels . He went to Key West every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of `` Commodore '' was never used without irony . Old Commodore Forsythe , who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without accidentally turning on something else first . Now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for Robinson to dive again : Rob was his boy , the kid he had rescued from the streets , the object of his pride .	`` Why '' , he went on , `` when Rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip , I didn ' t think twice about it . I ' ve helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around his brother ' s tackle shop . Hell , I gave him the first decent job he ever had , six , seven -- how many years ago was it , Rob '' ? ?	`` Seven years ago , Commodore '' , Rob said impassively . He was thinking , big deal : skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when I started .`` Excuse me '' , he said abruptly . He went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters ; ; went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him .	`` When you gotta go , you gotta go '' , Mrs . Forsythe said .	Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge . He was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the German , who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley .	`` Hi there , Schaffner '' , he had said .`` Can I make you one '' ? ?	`` No thank you very much '' , Schaffner had answered in his accented English .`` I do not drink so much , thank you '' .	Waddell had looked the man over , trying to size him up . He was in his early forties , rather short and very compactly built , and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to American ways . His open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence , until one looked into his eyes , which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence . Waddell had heard that he had been a commando in Rommel ' s Afrika Corps , and he said to himself : I ' d hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night . Aloud he had said , making conversation : 	`` Rob tells me he ' s using your Atlantis equipment on the dive '' .	`` Yes '' , Herr Schaffner had said .	`` He ' s one hell of a decent boy . I like that kid '' .	`` I agree , yes '' .	`` And if the dive goes OK he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country , is that right '' ? ?	`` Well , no '' , Herr Schaffner said .	Waddell turned to face him .`` No '' ? ? He asked .`` But that ' s what he told me . Why , that ' s his main reason for making the dive '' .	Shaffner looked at him , altogether without guile , and shrugged his shoulders , making a little spreading gesture with his two hands .	`` What do you mean '' ? ? Waddell asked , frowning .	`` Please let me explain '' , the German said earnestly , his face still devoid of deceit .`` I have in Europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year . Now I wish to enter the American market , where the competition is very strong . I must have a powerful representative here , a firm with a national distribution and ten , twenty thousand dollars to advertise my products . With all respect to a fine young man , Mr . Roy is not able to provide these necessaries '' .	Waddell was not an eminently moral person , but he did not like what he had just heard .`` Did you tell him all this '' ? ? He asked .	`` Perhaps not in so many words '' , the German said .`` But surely you have misunderstood Mr . Roy . Never , never did I offer him the exclusive rights . We spoke of the need for advertising , and I agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity . He was most eager to make the dive ; ; of course , I was willing . But there was no definite agreement about business arrangements '' .	`` Well , damn '' , Waddell said . There was the end of his front-page feature story , with byline . He started out the door .	`` One moment '' ! ! Herr Schaffner said .`` You intend to speak with Mr . Roy '' ? ?	`` What else '' ? ? Waddell asked .	`` If you will pardon , I think it would be better if not . Mr . Roy is determined to make this dive . Whatever you tell him he will dive . I know this from my talks with him '' .	`` Well , let ' s let him make up his own mind , OK '' ? ? Waddell said .`` On the basis of the facts '' .	`` You will make him unhappy and anxious '' , the German said .`` At 200 , 300 , 400 feet under the water , when he must be paying very much attention , he will be thinking about what you are telling him . It is not good , Mr . Waddell : you will do him great harm '' .	There was no doubt that Herr Schaffner meant every word of what he said . Waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk .	`` I am an honest man '' , the German said with fervor .`` I will give Mr . Roy his due for this dive . I will make him distributor for all of Florida -- a big market . All tourists come to Florida . This will help him to get out of his little tackle shop . Yes ! ! But there is no use causing him to worry at this time '' .	The German ' s words worked on the newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty . He took a big swig of his drink . It would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this .`` I think maybe you ' re right , Schaffner '' , he said .`` He has the distributorship for Florida , you say '' ? ?	`` Yes '' , the German said .`` At least for South Florida '' .	`` By God '' , Waddell said , `` we don ' t want to upset the boy at this time of all times . I guess you ' re right '' . He sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps . The story was shaping up nicely in his mind : the young pioneer , as of old , altruistically braving the unknown ; ; the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business America .`` Join me in another '' ? ? He had asked .	`` Thank you '' , the German had said courteously .`` I do not drink so much '' .Now , in that same cabin , Robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk . Fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions . He pressed his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers in a hurried and anxious whisper .	`` Blessed Saint Nicholas , I thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when I was bewildered . And when I make the dive again '' -- He paused ; ; crossed himself ; ; said a Hail Mary , slowly and with understanding . Folding between his hands the cross that hung from his neck , he took his appeal direct to Headquarters .`` Holy Mary , Mother of God , Star of the Sea , stay Thou with me on this next dive . Make it come off all right . Let me set the record this time , and let me get back OK , so the German will give me the exclusive . And make my life different and better from this time on . Amen '' .	He crossed himself again and rose . He felt a good deal less shaky . As he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found Artie , who came in and sat down on a bunk . Artie had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger . He waited awhile before he said , `` Roy , you know your decompression table , don ' t you '' ? ?	`` You know I know it '' , Robinson answered warily .	`` You came straight up from 275 without a stop '' , Artie said .	`` Well , I was a little bit confused . Anyway , I wasn ' t down long enough to matter . You don ' t see me stretched out on the deck , do you '' ? ?	`` You know what they say about two deep dives in one day '' , Artie went on , still twirling the snorkle and studying it intently .`` I don ' t think you should go down again '' .
	Early that day Matsuo saw a marine . The enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a hasty shot , then fled without knowing the result , ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were rubbery . As his feet slowed , he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand . He crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed .	In the leafiest part of the tree , straddling a broad horizontal limb , he could see over the meadow . For a while he was content to let events develop in their good time . He had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column , and while his shot had probably bred indecision , they would soon come hunting .	His superiors had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure . Yesterday ; ; today ; ; tomorrow : no surrender . His remembering the self-dictate brought no peace -- only a faint chill of doubt . He murmured to himself , with firmness : `` No surrender '' . It was best to die fighting the marines . His superiors had also preached this , saying it was the way for eternal honor .	What if the marines never came ? ? His comrades were all dead . He had no rice . Then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide .	Whichever the way , he would rot in this vast choking green , his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes . He sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk . His fingers touched the bone handle of a knife . The knife , an ammunition pouch , and a half-filled bottle of purified water hung on his belt . Besides the belt he wore a loin cloth .	As he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer , he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing . Gloom receded .	The marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed , as though debating whether to brave the sunlight . His fatigues made a streak of almost phosphorescent green in the mist .	`` Come out , come out in the meadow '' , Matsuo said under his breath .	The man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face . A signal ? ? Matsuo lifted his rifle , easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness .	Fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills . They had fought from caves , and the marines resorted to burning them out . Even now , like a ringing in his ears , he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting great orange billows . A wave of flame rippling through their cave had reached Nagamo , his friend , and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance , then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet , his uniform blazing . The marines let him advance . When he sank on his knees , they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of mercy .	Matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses , both the burned and the unburned , the latter decomposing rapidly under the tropical sun . The callous marines had laughed at each other ' s retching , while stacking bodies . Matsuo repeatedly choked down his own nausea . At nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside and into the jungle , reeking of death .	Apprehensively he peered to the left , to the right into the leafy , vine-crisscrossed maze . He decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow , with the one left to distract him . He strained his hearing . Cautious feet stepping on leafmold ; ; faint creaking of belts and slings ; ; whispers : he heard none of these . Only the hum of insects and the distant fluttering call of a bird . Because he couldn ' t hear them , he was more convinced they were there .	A spectacle occurred across the meadow : the lone marine took a seat on the ground ; ; leaning sidewise on a tree trunk , he embraced it . Humiliation made Matsuo tremble . While his comrades cocked the trap , that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver . Taking aim at the man ' s face , Matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge , and then he changed his mind . He wanted the arrogant marine to know fear , and so he aimed above the head .	The shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound . Hush followed . Like a mischievous boy expecting punishment , Matsuo awaited reaction from the jungle . How stupid to give his position away .	The jungle did not retort . The sitter remained seated hugging the tree . Before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy , and insects hummed and birds occasionally called . Matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete passiveness , concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke .	Five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight , immediately throwing his hands over his eyes . He went into a whirling dance , a sort of blind chasing of the tail . It ended when he tumbled ; ; but jumping right up , he staggered in no particular direction . He wore no head cover of any kind and , more odd , had no visible weapon .	With a sudden decisiveness he lurched in Matsuo ' s direction , crossing the meadow in a zigzagging gallop . When he got closer to the tree , Matsuo noted the wild look on his face . The pockets of his jacket bulged . Hand grenades .	The bobbing head was a poor target , so Matsuo shot him in the upper trunk .	The marine spun , clapping a hand high on his chest , and dived forward . In the hush that followed the echoes , Matsuo was tense . They could come on him now without difficulty . Gradually he reached a conclusion . The marine was alone , for they were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from the tree .	Down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage . The marine was sprawled some thirty yards away , one arm extended . Matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out . Reflex ? ?	Rifle leveled on the man , he made a rush . Heat , in the sunlight , pressed in like an invisible crowd .	He squatted by the head , gently placing the rifle on the ground . With a snakestrike motion he grasped the hair , and , twisting , pulled the marine over on his back . He was bearded . The bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone ; ; around the hole , blood glistened in a little patch . Maintaining his clutch on the hair , Matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in the jacket pockets . In one : a package of cigarettes and a tinplated lighter , both sticky from the man ' s bleeding . In the other : a wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief . One by one he tossed the objects aside . He didn ' t smoke and could not light fires with a flintless lighter ; ; he had no use any longer for exact time , even had the watch been running . Then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief .	Too bad the marine had no water . From its holder he took his own canteen . The cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied pressure . The marine ' s eyes opened , squeezed shut , then opened squinted in the glare .	So , alive . Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips . The marine reached up a hand . Matsuo shook his head .`` None for you '' . The marine blinked , soon dropping his hand . Not only had he no canteen , but he lacked even the belt to hang one on .`` You came well equipped to die '' .	Some odor made him lean over the man . He sniffed and recognized it . Sake . So that had been his difficulty . Drunk on sake , he must have wandered off from his bivouac .	The marine tried to roll on his right side , and moaned . When he rolled on the left side , propping on his left elbow , Matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over .`` Be a good turtle '' .	Awkwardly with one hand Matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle . The smell of sake had freshened yesterday ' s events in his thoughts . In the caves , with other supplies , they had kept cases of sake .	The marine shut his eyes .`` Are you a thrower of flame , marine '' ? ? Matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground , out of the marine ' s reach and away from their shadows . He waited in his squat , gripping the hair .	Every so often he turned the knife . Its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight . The sun was noon high and Matsuo perspired until his body was dripping . Wet also were the marine ' s fatigues and the face had an oily film . The man had thrown the left hand over his eyes . Now and again he murmured something that ended in a giggle . He must have saturated himself in the drink , for the bullet not to shock him out of his drunken haze . Matsuo shook his head . Strange .	At last he reached for the knife . Even the bone handle scorched , and he retrieved the marine ' s handkerchief to wrap it . First he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes . The marine yelled and flung the hand away . With a firm grip on the man ' s hair Matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek . A shrill yelp , kicked legs , and groping hands that circled Matsuo ' s wrist . Matsuo wrenched free and burned the hands into retreat ; ; burned the other cheek ; ; burned each hand when they came groping again . The marine commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment .	Matsuo stood up .`` A small measure of payment , marine '' . He dropped the knife in its scabbard , hung the rifle behind a shoulder .	The marine , hands on cheeks , rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach . He ceased weeping .	Matsuo walked toward his tree , once glancing back . The marine was still . He would soon die .	As Matsuo climbed by using the vines and kicking his feet against the trunk , a mood of gloom immersed him like a jungle shadow . What now ? ? In the jungle , birds were mute , while insects preserved only the monotony of living .	Someone called . It was the marine : head lifted , he strained and called . Then he astonished Matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat . He cupped his mouth and yelled . Matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder . Once and for all he ' d finish this marine who would not die . He aimed , but listened . It sounded as if the man were calling him : `` Hey , Japanese hey there , Japanese '' . The man tilted back his head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container . He performed the act twice more , and the begging in his tone grew more distinct .	`` Sake '' ? ? Matsuo called .	The marine nodded vigorously .	Matsuo laughed , slung the rifle . The marine was a winehead . His superiors had said that all marines were depraved .	The marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol . Remembering his own thirst , Matsuo took out his water bottle . One swallow was all he would have ; ; he was very thirsty , but he must observe water discipline . His years of campaigning had taught him the value of water discipline .	He began to uncap the bottle , the rusty cap squealing on its threads . Popping upright , the marine waved both hands and shouted .	Of course it was water he really craved ; ; down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out . The marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack . Matsuo shook his head . He had no water for an enemy . And when this was gone , he hadn ' t even a little bitter tablet to purify other water if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool .	He capped the bottle and replaced it . After all , he had less reason to desire it than the marine .	Before much longer the marine quieted down . His head slumped . The upper part of his packet had stained dark .`` Marine . There is nothing for you '' , Matsuo said .`` Your superiors will certainly beat you for your desertion , besides the dishonor of it . I ' ve nothing for you '' .	From the convulsive quivers of the man ' s shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping . He reminded Matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in China . In China it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform , smudged , blood-specked , with the village burning about him and shells exploding .
	Chairs scraped back and customers hastily vacated their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar . Only Blue Throat and his gang stayed where they were . Blue Throat was slumped with his back against the bar , elbows supporting his massive frame . He leered at the stranger as the distance between them closed .	`` Since when did they allow beardless kids into the saloon bars of this town , boys '' ? ? He asked .`` Seems to me I don ' t remember altering any law about that '' .	He straightened up , alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer .`` Stay right here where you are , kid '' , he called .`` I don ' t aim to have minors breathing down my neck when I ' m a-drinking '' : 	The stranger ignored him . He didn ' t stop till he was within three feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang leader ' s right hand was on the butt of his revolver .	`` I ' m Billy Tilghman '' , said the stranger , `` and I ' ve come for Pat Conyers ' body '' .	`` And what makes you think you ' re going to get it , pretty boy '' ? ?	`` Because I ' m asking . Most of the time I get what I ask for '' .	Blue Throat winked at his six cronies .`` The kid has no manners , boys . Shall we teach him some '' ? ? His gun was half drawn when he asked the question , but the weapon never left its holster . Tilghman ' s clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin . His head snapped round and he reeled back , crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling .	Tilghman leapt on to him , dragged him upright and hit him again , this time sending him careening against the bar . A bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from Tilghman ' s stomach as Blue Throat ' s henchmen started shooting . Tilghman flung himself aside , dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun .	The Colt roared twice and two men dropped , writhing . A third shot doused the light . Somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled , `` You all right , Billy '' ? ?	`` Yes , George , but I ain ' t got poor old Pat ' s body yet . And I aim to have it '' . He fired again , and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed . Another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor .`` OK , Tilghman , I ' m quitting '' .	`` And me '' , said another Blue Throat henchman .	Somebody brought a light . Tilghman and his partner , George Rust , herded the men into a corner .`` And now '' , said Tilghman with deadly calm , `` I ' ll repeat what I said . I ' ve come for Pat Conyers ' body '' .	In two minutes the body of Tilghman ' s former comrade , who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling brawl the previous night , was carried into the town ' s funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial . Blue Throat , nursing an aching jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride , rode out of town with the survivors of the fight .	`` That critter will be back tomorrow '' , predicted George Rust , `` and he ' ll bring fifty of his kind back with him . Blue Throat won ' t stand for this . He ' ll shoot up the town '' .	The prediction was correct . The Reverend James Doran had scarcely completed Pat Conyers ' last rites on Boot Hill in the township of Petrie , when shots were heard in the distance .	`` Amen '' , said the Reverend Doran , grabbing his rifle propped up against a tombstone , `` and now my brethren , it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere '' .	Billy Tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle . Blue Throat , who had ruled the town with his six-shooter for the last six months , certainly had no intention of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship . It was essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring , ruthless gun-slinger , and this was the time-honored Wild West method of doing it .	He rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance to Main Street . The entire length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn . Any posse riding down the street to demand Blue Throat ' s surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire .	The law-abiding citizens of Petrie had gathered inside Kaster ' s Store , halfway down the street . Several were firing into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived . He sized up the situation and shook his head .	`` If Blue Throat has his way he ' ll keep us all cooped up in here for days '' , he said .`` There ' s only one thing to move him fast , and we have it right here in this very store '' .	He called the store owner and together they went into the stockroom . Billy returned with six sticks of dynamite .`` I ' m gonna drop these into Blue Throat ' s lap '' , he announced , `` and I ' d like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near enough to toss ' em through the window '' .	He slipped outside , hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways . Blue Throat ' s men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts and board walk as he passed .	Fifty yards away from the barn he dodged inside a barber ' s shop and came out at the back . Here he couldn ' t be seen by Blue Throat and his gang . All he had to do was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks , run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through .	Billy Tilghman did just that . Within seconds the big barn was blasted into smoking splinters , with every outlaw either dead or injured inside . It was the abrupt end of Blue Throat ' s dictatorship in Petrie . Though only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to those parts .	To Tilghman the incident was just one of a long list of hair-raising , smash-' em-down adventures on the side of the law which started in 1872 when he was only eighteen years old , and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet .	Of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys of the Old West , `` Uncle Billy Tilghman '' stands out head and shoulders . He was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any other famous gun-slinging character in the book . He saw the most action , beat up more badmen with his bare fists , broke up the most gangs and sent more murderers to the gallows than any other U . S . marshal who lived before or after him .	For fifty years his guns and ham-like fists shot holes through and battered the daylights out of the enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the West .	The deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified almost to the point of hero-worship , but because Billy Tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career , his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the West have remained almost unsung .	Citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway , but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century .	He came within an ace of being riddled with bullets during his long fight with the Doolin gang which terrorized Oklahoma in the 1890 ' s . Led by Bill Doolin , these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns . Bill Doolin ' s ambition , it appeared , was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of Jesse James and Billy the Kid , and Bill Tilghman had sworn he would stop him .	Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang . They bought rustled cattle from the outlaw , kept him supplied with guns and ammunition , harbored his men in their houses . Billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers , named Ed Dunn , who lived at Rock Fort .	On a bitterly cold day in January , 1895 , accompanied only by Neal Brown as his deputy , Tilghman left the township of Guthrie and headed for Rock Fort and Dunn ' s ranch . It was snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside . The only evidence of occupation came from the chimney , which was belching out thick smoke .	The two lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door .`` Wait here , Neal '' , said Tilghman .`` If I don ' t come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse '' .	Leaving his rifle in the wagon , Tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it . There was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside . Directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire , a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day . Seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher , Ed Dunn .	`` Hello , Ed '' , said Tilghman . The rancher grunted an acknowledgement but didn ' t move .	Tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire . Suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck . Along each side of the room were six tiered bunks , each one screened off with a curtain .	And projecting wickedly through these curtains were the gleaming muzzles of six rifles , all trained on Billy Tilghman . The fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs might slam into his hide .	Thinking fast , Tilghman never hesitated for one instant . He walked right up to the fire as though blissfully unaware of the guns covering him . The men behind them were Bill Doolin and five of his gang -- every man a killer .	`` Cold day '' , said Tilghman , placing his hands behind him and casually presenting his backside to the fire .`` Just dropped in to ask where Jed Hawkins lives . Can ' t seem to locate landmarks in this snow '' .	The rancher was trembling . He wouldn ' t look Tilghman in the face .`` Follow the river for five miles '' , he said hoarsely .`` Jed ' s homestead is on the south bank '' .	Resisting the overwhelming temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap , Tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes . All that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body . One false move on his part and he would be a dead man .	`` Well '' , he announced , `` Guess I ' ll be going now , Ed , and thanks for the warmup '' . He strolled back to the door , whistling softly , hands still clasped behind him . He left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of Providence he had been allowed to come out alive .	But he knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon . If he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly .	Leisurely he climbed on to the wagon next to Neal Brown .`` Don ' t say or do anything '' , he said softly .`` Just get out of here without it looking as though we ' re in a hurry . That place is crawling with Bill Doolin and his gang '' .	Even as he spoke those words Billy Tilghman ' s life hung on a thread . Back in the house a hoodlum named Red Buck , sore because Billy had been allowed to leave unscathed , jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then .	`` You ' ll stay right here '' , commanded Bill Doolin , covering Red with his rifle .`` Billy Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back . We ' ll let him go '' .	But the fighting marshal ' s fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at Cromwell , Oklahoma , where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets .	Wiley Lynn , a self-styled prohibition officer , had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since . That night he reeled out of Ma Murphy ' s dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting off his revolver .
For several months now , Jack Carter , a big overgrown boy of fifteen with a fuzzy , pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot of red in them , had been haunted by a dream , a vision , of a Woman . This Woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face , but she radiated warmth , a sweet warmth ; ; she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately . When she would do these things , he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach . Then he would run to the toilet behind the house . Sometimes he did this three or four times a day , for this Woman was almost always with him . He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew -- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him . But they never said anything , so he figured it was all right .	And so when Miss Langford came to teach at the one-room Chestnut school , where Jack was a pupil in the eighth grade , the Woman of Jack ' s mind assumed the teacher ' s face and figure . He could not keep his eyes off her when at school ; ; when he went home at night , he took her with him in his mind , and she did the things the anonymous Woman used to do , and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do . When he awoke in the mornings , she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh .	Miss Langford ( her first name was Evelyn ) was an attractive girl . Tall , blonde , blue-eyes , fair , buxom without being heavy , she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh , starched summer dress . Something was beginning to stir and come alive in her , too ( it may have been there for a good while , since she was twenty now ; ; but if it had been , it had been smothered until now by fear ) : you could tell it by the way she watched the older , bigger boys , like Jack . She would look at Jack , with that hidden something in her eyes , and Jack would see the Woman and become breathless and a little sick .	School began in August , the hottest part of the year , and for the first few days Miss Langford was very lenient with the children , letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another . The first two or three days they went home early .	All , that is , except Jack . He hung around the schoolhouse , watching through a window from outside while Miss Langford straightened desks and put the room in order . Once ( this was on the third day of school ) she kneeled down to pick up some books where they ' d dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her dress -- at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg . He thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating . About that time Miss Langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him , he thought , although probably she didn ' t even see him . He jumped back , ducked and ran , crouching , down the hill away from the school .	He didn ' t look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath ; ; then he slowed to a walk . The vision became even stronger now .`` I ' ll get her yet '' , he muttered to himself .`` I ' ve got to get her '' . That night he dreamed a dream violent with passion , in which he and the Woman , now the teacher , did everything except engage in the act ( and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality ) , and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire .	He ate litle that morning , and his mother became concerned , inasmuch as he usually ate heartily .	`` What ' s the matter , honey '' ? ? She said , with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child .`` Aren ' t you hungry '' ? ?	`` No , I ' m not hungry '' , he said , pushing back the bacon and eggs . Outside it was already hot at 7 : 30 A . M . , and it was getting hot in the kitchen . He felt a little sick at his stomach .	`` Are you sick '' ? ?	`` No '' , he said .`` I ' ll be all right . I guess it ' s this hot weather '' .	`` Don ' t you play hard today then . And if you get sick , ask the teacher to let you come home early . Daddy left the car for me , and I ' m going to town this afternoon '' .	`` OK . , I won ' t play hard '' , he promised .	Just then Charles Lever yelled , `` Hey , Jack '' , from the quarry road which ran behind the Carter house , and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door , yelling `` Good-bye , Mom '' over his shoulder .	`` Whaddya say , boy '' ? ? Charles said , grinning , showing his huge yellow teeth . Charles , also fifteen , was tall and skinny , scraggly , with straight black hair like an Indian ' s and sharp brown eyes . He considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him .	`` You know what I done last night '' ? ? Charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the Dixie Highway , through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school .	Jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty , because girls were Charles ' only apparent interest . But Jack always derived vicarious sensual thrills from Charles ' revelations ( even when he suspected his friend of exaggeration or invention ) , so he usually invited them , as he did now .`` No . What '' ? ?	`` I got Margaret Rider in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry '' .	A nude imaginary picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jack ' s mind . His heart beat faster .`` Hell you say '' ? ? He said , lapsing into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with Charles .`` How ' d you do it '' ? ?	`` Hell , I jist got on top of -- '' 	`` No , I mean how ' d you get her to do it '' ? ?	`` Hell , I jist ask her '' .	`` Jist like that '' ? ?	`` Hell , yes . She ' s been hangin ' around me a lot here lately , and I figgered I might as well ' s try it . Besides I heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin ' it '' .	`` I never heard that '' .	`` It ' s all over Branchville . If you ' d get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your ownself '' .	`` I might try it one of these days '' , Jack said wonderingly , thinking of Miss Langford .When they reached the school , a gang of boys and girls were already there playing `` crack the whip '' in front of the schoolhouse . Miss Langford , in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals , without socks , was out there with them , trying to get them inside .	`` Time for books '' , she yelled , jingling a little five-and-dime store bell in her right hand .`` Let ' s go inside '' .	`` Oh , come on Miss Langford , play with us just onct '' , one of the little girls begged , smiling wistfully .	`` No , not now '' , said the teacher .`` Maybe at dinner time . Come inside now '' .	The children grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse .	Jack watched Miss Langford all morning . He could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles had said that morning about Margaret Rider . Occasionally he would look across the aisle at Margaret , fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress , sitting in the sixth-grade row , and he could hardly believe she would do what Charles had said she did .	At noontime , remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids , Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys , except Charles , went off out the road to play ball .`` Why ain ' t you playin ' ball '' ? ? He asked Charles suspiciously as they sat in the well-house shade , watching the girls congregate in front of the schoolhouse .`` Miss Langford , come out and play with us like you promised '' , several of the little girls called .	`` I ' d druther stay here and watch the girls '' , Charles grinned .`` Maybe some of ' em will fall down and we ' ll see up their dress '' .	`` Maybe '' , Jack said idly , watching for Miss Langford .	Presently she came out of the schoolhouse . When she appeared , two or three of the little girls jumped up and down , yelling , `` Goody , goody '' .	`` Let ' s play with ' em '' , Jack said , rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants .	`` O . K . '' Charles rose also , and the two of them moved over to join the girls .	They played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap . Then when Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls , Jack , in the middle of the line , gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards , sitting down hard , her dress flying over her head . While she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again , Jack ran over , offered her his hand and said , `` Gosh , I ' m sorry , Miss Langford . I didn ' t mean to pull so hard '' .	`` That ' s all right '' , she said , tossing her head back to get the hair out of her eyes .`` It was my fault '' . With one hand she held her skirt down while she took Jack ' s extended hand with the other . When her hand touched his , fire went through Jack and he felt weak , but he managed somehow to get her on her feet . He thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go .	`` Thank you '' , she said , dusting herself off .	`` Will you play with us again , Miss Langford '' ? ? One of the little girls said .	`` No more today . Maybe some other day '' .	`` Oh , shucks '' , the girl said .`` I don ' t believe I ' ll play any more neither '' .	`` Me neither '' , others said , and soon the game broke up , the children going off in pairs , in larger groups and alone .	Jack walked off alone out the road in the searing midday sun , past Robert Allen ' s three-room , tarpapered house , toward the field where the other boys were playing ball , thinking of what he would do in order to make Miss Langford have him stay in after school -- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes .	When he came back to the schoolhouse , his mind was made up . He simply would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class . That should do it , he thought , because Miss Langford had said she was going to be strict about school work . He had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him , but he couldn ' t take a chance on either of these possibilities : the teacher probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay in after school .	The only drawback now to the plan he ' d decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work , too , and the teacher would have that person stay late along with Jack .`` But I ' ve got to take a chance on it '' , he told himself desperately .	To his surprise his plan worked perfectly .`` All right , if you can ' t do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out '' , Miss Langford said firmly , not smiling .`` You will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems '' .	And so when the others stampeded out that afternoon Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed , going home . He scarcely saw them . His heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was trying to think , his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child , `` How will I do it ? ?
	On the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise . She munched little ginger cakes called mulatto ' s belly and kept her green , somewhat hypnotic eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot king snake wrapped around his bronze neck .	The youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman . Lithe and muscular , he had well-molded features , and his light color told of the European ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family .	The haughty white girl turned to a distinguished , hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured : `` Look at your watch , Col . Garvier . It is almost time for and calinda to begin '' .	Col . Henri Garvier was one of New Orleans ' most important and enlightened slave owners . He chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start . The slaves ran gaily to the center of Congo Square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called Johnny No-Name .	Johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer bones against the gourd which served as his drum . He showed his gleaming tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently , his brass earrings jangling discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy .	The drummer flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda , a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners and their disciples in the Louisiana slave compounds . The dance was of Haitian origin .	The white girl with the penetrating green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 , who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows . He was possessive in his manner and , though a slave , obviously was educated after a fashion and imitated the manners of his owners . He proudly wore the blue livery of her house , for the girl was Madame Delphine Lalaurie , wife of the prominent surgeon , Dr . Louis Lalaurie , who bore one of the South ' s oldest and most cherished names .	Delphine was a pace-setter in high society . She was a top horsewoman and one of the city ' s most gracious hostesses . Although New Orleans was not to learn of it for a spell , she also was a sadist , a nymphomaniac and unobtrusively mad -- the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on American soil .	Madame Lalaurie gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders . The slender , handsome fellow was called Dandy Brandon by the other slaves . He was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race . But Dandy had had little experience with girls on his master ' s plantation in Bayou St . John .	Shy , actually , he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant of the girls ' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in the open fields , in carriages and in boathouses .	This young slave was therefore quite unprepared when Delphine Lalaurie signaled that she wanted him to draw near . The woman eyed the youth with the avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is not yet in his collection .	`` What is your name , boy ? ? Come a bit closer . I won ' t bite , you know '' .	He gaped at Madame Lalaurie and sniffed the Paris perfume which emanated from her . Then he smiled shyly .`` My name is Dandy Brandon , missy . I belong to Master Alexander Prieur '' .	She said with intense feeling : `` Come near , let me feel your arms . You look quite strong and healthy to me , Dandy '' .	Mrs . Lalaurie impatiently propelled the slave toward her waiting carriage . Lifting her skirts , she climbed in , never relinquishing her grip on his arm . The woman seemed utterly unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor .	Once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau , she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army inductees . Satisfied at last , and after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced Delphine that Dandy was capable of learning new arts , she opened the window and called to her liveried driver . This was the big man with the proprietory air and the beetling , shaggy eyebrows .	`` Aristide ! ! I want you to find Monsieur Prieur at once and give him this money for the boy ' s purchase . There ' s $600 in gold in this chamois sack . If the old fool argues about the price , tell him I shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer . Prieur has gout and depends on Louis ' pills and bleedings . Besides , he owns 300 slaves . One less shouldn ' t matter to him '' .	Aristide Devol , the sardonic manservant who had been brought in chains years before from his native Sierra Leone , smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed beaver hat . His bold eyes raked the woman , and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner .	`` Another youth , Madame '' ? ? The coachman said softly .`` This one is a tender chicken , oui ? ? Such delicate beauty , such fine flesh . It will rip and shred easily for Madame '' .	`` Be quiet , Devol ! ! You are forgetting your place '' .	The tall coachman walked off briskly in search of Alexander Prieur . Delphine Lalaurie took the reins in her gloved hands and drove Dandy Brandon -- cowering in the back seat of the carriage -- to her mansion at 677 Perdido Street .	Dr . Louis Lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the pillared mansion . Dandy , curiosity overcoming his apprehensions , peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle . He saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head . Dr . Lalaurie wore a maroon smoking jacket , and his myopic eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses . He was about 50 years old .	`` Another young man , my dear ? ? Really , you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself '' , he said , frowning with displeasure .	Delphine presented her cheek for a kiss , and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster .	`` Dandy is to be our house guest , Louis . I want the room in the attic prepared for him He is a most unusual lad , quite precocious in many ways . He deserves a better life than just rotting away on the Prieur plantation '' .	`` Quite so , my dear . His room will be ready shortly '' .	The physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave . Had Dandy been older or wiser , instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the Lalauries ' tender care if he valued his life .	But he liked the smell of Delphine ' s perfume . Besides , her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth . Also , he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony .	So Dandy Brandon trustingly entered the house with Delphine Lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home . Airless and dingy though it was , the attic represented luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at Bayou St . John .	He bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted when Madame Lalaurie -- after closing the door -- showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber .	It was just as well that the ignorant Dandy enjoyed himself to the hilt that first evening , for the room was to become his prison cell . When he finally left the sinister mansion on Perdido Street , he was carried out in a coroner ' s basket .Just six weeks after Dandy Brandon ' s arrival at the mansion , the little surgeon and his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball , to which only New Orleans ' oldest and wealthiest families were invited .	A stringed orchestra played softly behind the potted palms , and Delphine circulated graciously among her guests , chatting airily of the forthcoming races , the latest fashions from Paris , and Louisiana politics .	Suddenly there was a commotion upstairs , a despairing boyish shriek , and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase .	It was Dandy Brandon , clad only in a bloody loincloth , emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him . The lad ' s once superb body was a mass of scars and welts . His pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition .	Feebly he pointed an accusing finger at Madame Lalaurie and shouted : `` Evil woman ! ! You did this you like to hurt to beat people I want to go home '' .	These were the last words he ever uttered . Convulsively , he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of Senator Gaston Berche , crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician wore .	Dr . Louis Lalaurie examined the inert form of the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead . The ball broke up in confusion . Guests stared with horror at Madame Lalaurie and made speedy departures . Delphine stood like stone , her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse .	But at the coroner ' s inquest Delphine told a forthright story .	`` I saw the boy Dandy at the Congo Square festivities and felt sorry for him . It was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom when the right time came , for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest . After I paid Monsieur Prieur for Dandy , I brought him home , but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night . How he returned in such a ghastly condition , or why , I cannot say . Dr . Lalaurie and I didn ' t even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs '' .	She daubed at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said with obvious emotion : `` That poor boy ! ! He must have fallen in with evil companions , for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and inexperienced . Ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die . Such a pitiful end '' ! !	Though the slave ' s dying words about the woman troubled the coroner ' s panel , Dandy ' s accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury and disregarded . The Lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder , and even a jury didn ' t feel privileged to doubt the veracity of so illustrious a lady . Moreover , runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New Orleans ' dives .	So the verdict was `` death at the hands of a person or persons unknown '' , and the elite of the city , accepting Delphine ' s testimony , welcomed her and the doctor back into the fold . Once again life went its serene way -- soirees , fox hunts , balls and dinners .	The excitement over Brandon ' s bizarre death abated and Madame Lalaurie ' s stock soared when she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital . Then , on July 2 , there occurred another incident which set tongues to wagging at a furious clip .	Mrs . Victor Dominique , socially prominent and a neighbor of the Lalauries , chanced to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight . The manservant Devol and his mistress , Delphine Lalaurie , were pursuing a young girl -- an octoroon of cameo-like beauty -- across the front lawn of the Lalaurie mansion . The girl was not more than 16 . She was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not conceal the knife slashes on her back .	The bleeding girl was tiring fast ; ; the coachman and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down Perdido Street .	The fugitive cried out in an oddly sibilant voice : `` Help me , somebody ! ! They have pulled out all my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw ! !
`` Bastards '' , he would say , `` all I did was put a beat to that Vivaldi stuff , and the first chair clobbered me '' ! ! Since then , and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent -- and even indecent -- group from Greenwich Village to the Embarcadero , he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper .	`` There ain ' t nothin ' faster , or lonelier , or more direct than a cannonball freight when you wanna go someplace '' , Feathertop would say .`` The accommodations may not be the poshest , but man ! ! There ain ' t nobody askin ' for your ticket stub , neither '' .	He had been conning the freights for a long , long time now . Ever since the hooch , and the trouble with the Quartet , and Midge and the child . Ever since all that . It had been a very long time that had no form and no end .	He was -- as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer his own -- riding the dark train out . Out and out and never to return again . Till one day the last freight had been jumped , the last pint had been killed , the last beat had been rapped . That was the day it ended .The freight car was cold , early in the morning .	He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks , the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina .	He held his elbows away from his body , and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tune-belly .	The train slowed at a road crossing , and the big door slid open ; ; at first gratingly , caught by grains of corn -- then with a clash into its slot .	The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor . She pulled her legs up under her , to rise , her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs , and Feathertop ' s music pfffted away .`` Now that is a very nice , a very nice '' , he murmured to himself , back in his corner .	A little thing , but the right twist for the action that counted . Hot , that was the word , hot ! ! Hair like a morning-frightened sparrow ' s wings , with the sun shining down over them . A poet , yet ! ! His thoughts for the swanlike neck , the full , high breasts , the slim waist , and the long legs were less than poetic , however .	Zingggg-O ! !	Then the boy straight-armed himself up , twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting .	He was less to see , but Feathertop took him in , too , just to keep the records straight .	Curly hair , high cheekbones , wide gnomelike mouth , a pair of drummer ' s blocky hands , and a body that said well , maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes -- but then I ' m finished .	`` We made it , Cappy '' , the chick said .	`` Yeah , seems so , don ' t it '' , the boy laughed , hugging her close .	`` Ah-ah '' ! ! Feathertop interrupted , standing up , brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants .`` None of that . We run a respectable house here '' .	They whirled and saw him , standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall . He was big , and filthy , and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes . He held the black plastic kazoo lightly .	`` Come sit '' , said Feathertop , motioning them toward him .`` That crap is softer over here '' .	The girl smiled , and started forward . The boy yanked her back hard , tugging her off her feet , and gathered her into the crook of his arm .	`` Now stay with me , Kitty '' , he snapped irritably .`` I vowed to take care of you -- and that ' s what I ' m gonna do . We don ' t know this guy '' .	`` Oooo , square bit '' , Feathertop screwed his face up . This guy was strictly from Outsville . But nowhere ! !	`` What is with this vow jazz '' ? ? Feathertop inquired , lounging against the freight ' s vibrating wall .	`` We -- we eloped '' , Cappy said . His head came up and he said it defiantly .	`` Well , congratulations '' . Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand . These two were going to be easy pickins . They couldn ' t have much dough , but then none of the freight-bums Feathertop rolled had much . And besides , the chick had a little something the others didn ' t have . That was gonna be fun collecting ! !	But not just yet . Feathertop was a connoisseur . He liked to savor his meat before he tasted it .`` Come sit '' , he repeated , motioning to the piled hay bags , over the pig leavings .`` I ' m just a poor ex-jazz man , name of -- uh -- Boyd Smith '' . He grinned at them wolfishly .	`` That ain ' t your name , Mister '' , the boy accused .	`` And you know -- you ' re right '' ! ! Feathertop aimed a finger at him .	`` Oh , come on , Cappy '' , the girl chided .`` He ' s okay . He ' s a nice guy '' . She started to move toward the hay bags , dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her .	Feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim , trim legs as she walked to the bags , and tucked them beneath her , smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle . He cleared his throat ; ; it had been a long , hot while since he ' d seen anything as nice as this within grabbin ' distance .	He had it all doped , of course . Slug the kid , grab his dough -- at least enough to get to Philadelphia -- and then have a rockin ' ball with the doll . Hmm -- diddle ! !	`` Where ' d you come from , Mr . -- uh -- Mr . Smith '' ? ? Kitty inquired politely .	`` Where from '' ? ? He mused .`` Out . I been riding train for a ways now '' .	They lapsed into silence , and the freight wallowed up a hill , scooted down the other side , shaking and clanking to itself .	After a while , Kitty murmured something to Cappy , and he held her close , answering , `` We ' ll just have to wait till we pull into Philly , honey '' .	`` What ' s the matter , she wanna go the bathroom '' ? ? Ernie found it immensely funny .	The boy scowled at him , and the girl looked shocked .	`` No ! ! Certainly not , I mean , no that isn ' t what I said '' ! ! She snapped at him .`` I only said I was hungry . We haven ' t had anything to eat all day '' .	Joviality suffused Feathertop Ernie Cargill ' s voice as he reached behind him , pulling out a battered carpet bag , with leather handles .`` Whyn ' t ya say so , fellow travelers ! ! Why , we got dinner right here . C ' mon , buddy , help me set up the kitchen and we ' ll have food in a minute or two '' .	Cappy looked wary , but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of the refuse-littered boxcar .	Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag . He took out a small packet filled with bits of charcoal , a deep pot of thin metal , some sheets of newspaper , a book of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with holes in it . He put the charcoal in the pot , lit the paper with the matches , and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot .	`` A charcoal pit , man '' , he said , indicating the slightly-smoking makeshift brazier .`` Fan it '' , he told Cappy , handing him a sheet of newspaper .	`` Yeah , but what ' re we gonna eat ? ? Charcoal '' ? ?	`` Fella '' , Ernie waggled a dirty finger at the younger man , `` you try my ever-lovin ' patience '' . He reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners .	`` Hot dogs , man . Not the greatest , but they stick to your belly insides '' .	He ripped down the cellophane carefully , and laid three dogs on the tin foil . Almost immediately they began to sizzle . He looked up and grinned .	`` A Kroger ' s self-serve '' , he explained .`` I self-served '' .When they had licked the last of the wieners ' taste from their fingers , they settled back , and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette . Nice kid , Ernie thought , too bad .	`` How come you ' re riding the rods , kids like you '' ? ? Ernie asked .	Cappy looked down at his wide hands , and did not reply . But surprisingly , Kitty ' s face came up and she said , `` My father . He didn ' t want us to get married . So we ran away '' .	`` Why didn ' t he want you to get hitched '' ? ?	This time even she did not answer . She looked down at her hands , too . After a few seconds , she said , `` Dad didn ' t like Cappy . It was my fault '' .	Cappy ' s head came around sharply .`` Your fault , hell ! ! It was all my fault . If I ' d been careful it never woulda '' -- he stopped abruptly .	Ernie ' s eyebrows went up .`` What ' s the matter '' ? ?	The girl still did not raise her eyes , but she added simply , `` I ' m pregnant '' .	Cappy raged at himself .`` Oh he was stupid , her old man ! ! You never heard nothin ' like it : Kitty ' s gonna go have an abortion , and Kitty ' s gonna go away to a convent , and Kitty ' s this and Kitty ' s that like he was nuts or somethin ' , y ' know '' ? ?	Ernie nodded . This was a slightly different matter . He remembered Midge , and the child . But that had been a time before all this , a time he didn ' t think about . A time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out . But these kids weren ' t like him .	Oh crap ! ! He thought , Pull out of it , old son . These are just another couple of characters to roll . What they got , you get . Now forget all this other .	`` Wanna drink '' ? ? Ernie offered , taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket .	`` Yeah . Now that you offer '' . The answer came from the open door of the boxcar . From the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside , as the train had slowed on the grade .	Ernie stared at the man . He was big . Real big , with shoulders out to here , and hair all over him like a grizzly . Road gang , Ernie thought .	`` You gonna give me a drink , fella '' ? ? The big man asked again , taking a step into the boxcar .	Ernie hesitated a moment . This character could break him in half .`` Sure '' , he said , and lifted the pint to his own lips . He guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered the remainder . The man stalked toward them , his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring . He took the bottle with undue belligerence , and making sucking noises with his thick lips , drained it completely .	He threw his head back , closed his eyes , and belched ferociously . He belched again , and opening his eyes , threw the bottle out the open door .	`` Well , now '' , he said , and reached into his pocket .`` I didn ' t know I was gonna have company in this car '' .	`` We ' re going to Philadelphia '' , Kitty said , pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more .	`` No , I don ' t think so '' , said the big man , and it was the final clincher for Ernie . He had suspected this guy was trouble , and now he was sure of it .	`` Maybe you and me will , girlie , but these two ain ' t goin ' nowhere '' .	He advanced on them , and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car . Ernie was screaming inside himself : No , damn you , you ain ' t gonna take my meal ticket away from me ! !	The newcomer stalked toward them , and Kitty shied back , her hand to her mouth . Her scream split up the silence of the car , accompanied by the rattling of the freight , and then Cappy came off the floor , his legs driving him hard . The kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump ! ! And carried him backward in a footballer ' s tackle . They went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs .	The kid showed for an instant , and his arm was cocked back . The fist went down into the pile of flesh , and Ernie heard the bigger man ' s deeper voice go , `` Aaawww '' ! !	Then they were tumbling again , and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier , and came up with a vicious switchblade .	He held the knife aloft an instant -- an instant enough to press the stud . The blade came out with a snick ! ! He fisted the knife overhand , and drew back to plunge it into the kid ' s throat .	Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white . She grabbed at Feathertop ' s sleeve and shrieked , `` Help him ! ! Help him ! ! Do something '' ! !
	I was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea . She made me welcome . Her dark cool caresses were sweeter than any woman ' s ; ; the many little tricks she knew made her embrace the ultimate one -- the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me but the air I breathed into a nitrogen anesthetic . yielding-Mediterranian-woman- , she soothed me , and drew me deeper into her .	I no longer knew how deep I was , somewhere under 230 feet , getting drunker , happier and more contented by the second . The reasons for this dive seemed foolish now . Only the dive itself had any meaning . The metal-tasting nitrogen made me wonder if I should remove the mouthpiece and suck in the sweet water . Perhaps if I took off the aqua-lung I could swim better , love my woman better . I chuckled aloud , and the mouthpiece fell out .	While a hazy part of my mind concentrated on swimming down , a clear part sorted over recent events , among them my only positive act in a long time . It was when I packed up what duds I had and went to Paris . It was no vacation , just me getting out after a bellyfull . I knew it wouldn ' t be the same . Wild kicks never are , but I hoped to dig up a better frame of mind .	Once before I had been to Paris , long before I married Valery . That first time was good and it stuck with me . I was twenty-one back then , in the army , and fog put our plane down at Orly instead of Rhine-Main . It was a Saturday evening in April with a mist-like rain , and I was a little high on the good taste of life . I had a pocketful of money , which was unusual when I was in the army , and the plane would be grounded all night . In less than an hour I had gotten a hotel , showered , shaved and was out on the Champs Elysees in a fresh uniform . I felt like a Hun in Rome .	All the women were beautiful , and the men were equal to them ; ; everything was glamorous to my dazzled eyes . There were some sweet machines other than women : an old Bugatti , a lean Farina coachwork on an American chassis , a Swallow , a type A40-AjK Mercedes and lots more . There was the Arc de Triomphe and the Tour d ' Eiffel -- I was no yokel , but I was young , and this was Paris ! !	I had champagne at Maxim ' s , then went into a cafe called the Jour et Nuit to ask the way to Montmartre . I never got there . I met Claire , which was better . She was eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly could , and washing it down with red wine . I stared . I didn ' t know a human could feed so fast and still be beautiful . She was blonde , and young , and nice and round in a tight white dress . Maybe her ravenous eating wasn ' t grotesque because she was so positive about it .	When she had drained the last of the bottle and paid her bill , she came directly to my table and said : 	`` Handsome soldier , I have assuaged one hunger with food . I feel another of terrible urgency . Is your evening free '' ? ?	`` Madame '' , I said with noblesse oblige because of the `` handsome '' -- `` yeah '' .	And so off we went to her apartment . She was a nymphomaniac , of course , the poor girl . Toward the break of day I waxed philosophical , and drew analogies about her way of eating bread and cheese .	Now it was nine years later , and it wasn ' t spring but winter when I returned .	I got there on a Saturday evening . I made the mistake of going to the Jour et Nuit . The place was busy but I didn ' t feel like a Hun . I sat waiting for Life to come along and sweep me up . I had part of a bottle of French beer called Panther Pils ( so help me ) , then switched to Tuborg . After a few hours , Life hadn ' t showed , and I was crocked . I went to my hotel and slept . The next morning a little cognac made me feel better -- but what can you do in Paris on Sunday morning ? ? So I drank more cognac .	All that day and Monday I drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space . I read the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer . Elemental , but sex . That ' s what was on my mind . I was turning over the idea of a good debauchery when I dozed off .	I felt better Tuesday evening when I woke up . My head was clear , my thinking sober and I was reconciled to this Paris idea as a flop on top of all my others . A good binge has that kind of therapeutic value .	Sometime earlier the weather had turned cold and it was snowing . I went out into it . I walked around breathing the cold wine of the air until I found a park , and I sat down on a snowy bench where the light was dim and came from the sky . There was dignity and beauty in the little white flakes falling through the blue night . I had on only a topcoat , but I wasn ' t cold . I was just miserable .	Pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick . She saw me and sat down beside me , three feet away . Suddenly I understood why she had the umbrella . It gave her poise and posture . Without it she would have been drab and limp . It gave her propriety . It gave her the right to sit down beside me , back straight , one hand out on the handle . I couldn ' t imagine her without it . I knew all about her . She was another human being and happened to be a hustler . I didn ' t much care if she were there or not .	After a while she said with sort of an unuttered laugh , `` You have snow in your hair and ears '' .( I didn ' t have on a hat .) 	Hardly glancing at her , I smiled a bleak one which said , Thanks , baby , but I ' d rather be alone .	She was silent for a while , then said , `` Why are you so unhappy '' ? ?	`` I ' m not unhappy '' , I lied , staring at the snow . She was trying to make a hole in my armor , and I didn ' t want it .	`` Is it a woman '' ? ? She asked gently . She must have seen the ring on my left hand .	`` Well -- women and unhappiness go together '' , I observed profoundly , adding , `` You can wager your derriere on that '' .	`` Ah , Monsieur , it is not my business to wager it .'' 	This took me so funny I had to look at her . I felt my frozen sad face crumble , and I grinned a silly one I couldn ' t have helped . I even snorted a chuckle .	She smiled at me , but it was an awfully sad smile . She was even more miserable than me . Her eyes were smiling , too , but so sadly , and there was tiredness and infinite wisdom in them .`` Now isn ' t it better to smile '' ? ? She asked .	Because I liked this sad person so much , I said , `` Will you have a drink with me '' ? ?	I could see the ancient cynicism reinforce itself in her eyes , and I wondered how many men she had picked up with this same gambit .	Anyway , I pulled a bottle of Remy Martin out of my topcoat , drew the cork , and passed it to her .	I could see she was shocked .	`` I ' m sorry I haven ' t got a glass '' , I said .	`` Non , non '' , she said , taking the bottle , `` not for that be sorry '' .	She tilted up and drank , and then I drank . It ' s really rotten to drink good cognac like that , but I hadn ' t cared before . I wasn ' t going to lug around a glass .	There wasn ' t much light in the blue dark , but I could see her well . No child , this tart , she must have been thirty-five or even forty . I couldn ' t be sure . Somehow she was attractive . Not good looking , but self-confident and wise so that it made her attractive . I liked her , and all at once I was glad she was there .	We finished the bottle -- I hadn ' t had a lot out of it earlier -- not speaking much to each other , and we stayed sober .	I suppose we were cold , but we didn ' t feel it . We seemed to be drowsing , sadly , soberly , in the cold , cold air while the snow fell . Then she said , `` Allons '' , and we got up and went to my hotel without another word .	I sensed no stranger in her . We undressed and made love with the comfortable acceptance I had once known with Valery . I decided thirty-five was the best estimate of her age . She had a funny little scar on her stomach , on the left side .	I think we were very tired , for we awoke at the same moment , deeply rested , surprised to see the late morning sun on the windows , which were wet where the rime had melted .	I felt wonderful , the absolute opposite of last night ' s melancholy . My head was clear . I was hungry as a wolf , and my body felt lean and vital .	`` Bon jour '' , I said brightly , sitting up , which pulled the covers to her hips . She looked good , with her short tousled hair and no make-up . Maybe closer to thirty , I thought .	`` Bon jour '' ! ! She exclaimed , smiling .`` J ' ai faim '' ! !`` Yeah , but breakfast first '' .	With a laugh she beat me to the bathroom . I called downstairs for food and a toothbrush for her . She came out pink from a hot bath , and I gave her my robe . I had brushed my teeth , showered , shaved and dressed by the time a waiter wheeled in breakfast .	`` The toothbrush Monsieur '' , he said , presenting it . I gave it to the woman .	`` What is this for '' ? ? She asked innocently .	`` Why , to brush your teeth '' .	`` But I already have ! ! I used yours '' .	`` Oh '' ? ? I said with round eyes . I wondered if I ought to go use the new one myself . But I smelled the coffee , and thinking , What the hell , live dangerously , I decided I would scald my worries away . The coffee wasn ' t very hot though , made in a filter pot , but it was good . We sent the waiter away and ate a tremendous amount of cold ham , hot hard-boiled eggs and hot garlic bread . As we ate , we talked . Her name was Suzanne , and mine Stephen .	We sat back comfortably on the bed with our last cups of coffee .	`` You are very tactful , do you know , Stephen '' , she remarked .	`` Um '' ? ? I grunted , sipping .	`` Yes , because you didn ' t run off to use that new toothbrush '' .	I raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror .	`` I didn ' t really use yours '' , she went on .`` I carry one in my purse . I know men never kiss les putains '' .	To my immense relief , she changed the subject in the next sentence : `` Shall we go to the Louvre today '' ? ?	`` All right '' . I said with enthusiasm at the idea .`` But not immediately '' . I put aside my empty cup . She smiled all the way to her wise , sad eyes , and drained her own .	We were not rushed .	`` What is this from '' ? ? I asked , touching the scar on her stomach . It was like a long thin line drawn through a pink circle .	`` A bullet '' , she answered . The cynicism was back in her eyes , a bitter wisdom , and I wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all . She understood sex anyway , and played at it well .	We went to the Louvre for a few hours , then by Metro to a cabaret in Montmartre .	It was a nice place , not filled with smoke . We had champagne and steamed mussels . The sommelier brought the wine first , a magnum instead of the bottle I had ordered . He must have thought I was a tourist .	I fixed him with a steely eye and said , `` What ' s this for ? ? I didn ' t ask for a Jeroboam of champagne '' .	I thought that was pretty humorous , but I didn ' t laugh .
	Two letters had arrived for Miss Theresa Stubblefield : she put them in her bag . She would not stop to read them in American Express , as many were doing , sitting on benches or leaning against the walls , but pushed her way out into the street . This was her first day in Rome and it was June .	An enormous sky of the most delicate blue arched overhead . In her mind ' s eye -- her imagination responding fully , almost exhaustingly , to these shores ' peculiar powers of stimulation -- she saw the city as from above , telescoped on its great bare plains that the ruins marked , aqueducts and tombs , here a cypress , there a pine , and all around the low blue hills . Pictures in old Latin books returned to her : the Appian Way Today , the Colosseum , the Arch of Constantine . She would see them , looking just as they had in the books , and this would make up a part of her delight . Moreover , nursing various Stubblefields -- her aunt , then her mother , then her father -- through their lengthy illnesses ( everybody could tell you the Stubblefields were always sick ) , Theresa had had a chance to read quite a lot . England , France , Germany , Switzerland , and Italy had all been rendered for her time and again , and between the prescribed hours of pills and tonics , she had conceived a dreamy passion by lamplight , to see all these places with her own eyes . The very night after her father ' s funeral she had thought , though never admitted to a soul : Now I can go . There ' s nothing to stop me now . So here it was , here was Italy , anyway , and terribly noisy .	In the street the traffic was really frightening . Cars , taxis , buses , and motorscooters all went plunging at once down the narrow length of it or swerving perilously around a fountain . Shoals of tourists went by her in national groups -- English school girls in blue uniforms , German boys with cameras attached , smartly dressed Americans looking in shop windows . Glad to be alone , Theresa climbed the splendid outdoor staircase that opened to her left . The Spanish Steps .	Something special was going on here just now -- the annual display of azalea plants . She had heard about it the night before at her hotel . It was not yet complete : workmen were unloading the potted plants from a truck and placing them in banked rows on the steps above . The azaleas were as large as shrubs , and their myriad blooms , many still tight in the bud , ranged in color from purple through fuchsia and rose to the palest pink , along with many white ones too . Marvelous , thought Theresa , climbing in her portly , well-bred way , for she was someone who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to notice everything . In Rome , all over Europe , she intended to move very slowly indeed .	Halfway up the staircase she stopped and sat down . Other people were doing it , too , sitting all along the wide banisters and leaning over the parapets above , watching the azaleas mass , or just enjoying the sun . Theresa sat with her letters in her lap , breathing Mediterranean air . The sun warmed her , as it seemed to be warming everything , perhaps even the underside of stones or the chill insides of churches . She loosened her tweed jacket and smoked a cigarette . Content excited ; ; how could you be both at once ? ? Strange , but she was . Presently , she picked up the first of the letters .	A few moments later her hands were trembling and her brow had contracted with anxiety and dismay . Of course , one of them would have to go and do this ! ! Poor Cousin Elec , she thought , tears rising to sting in the sun , but why couldn ' t he have arranged to live through the summer ? ? And how on earth did I ever get this letter anyway ? ?	She had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had managed to find her . Her Cousin Emma Carraway had written it , in her loose high old lady ' s script -- t ' s carefully crossed , but l ' s inclined to wobble like an old car on the downward slope . Cousin Emma had simply put Miss Theresa Stubblefield , Rome , Italy , on the envelope , had walked up to the post office in Tuxapoka , Alabama , and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday card to her next-door neighbor . No return address whatsoever . Somebody had scrawled American Express , Piazza di Spagna ? ?, across the envelope , and now Theresa had it , all as easily as if she had been the President of the Republic or the Pope . Inside were all the things they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness , death , and burial of Cousin Alexander Carraway .	Cousin Emma and Cousin Elec , brother and sister -- unmarried , devoted , aging -- had lived next door to the Stubblefields in Tuxapoka from time immemorial until the Stubblefields had moved to Montgomery fifteen years ago . Two days before he was taken sick , Cousin Elec was out worrying about what too much rain might do to his sweetpeas , and Cousin Elec had always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a mother-of-pearl paper knife which Theresa had coveted as a child and which he had promised she could have when he died . I ' m supposed to care as much now as then , as much here as there , she realized , with a sigh . This letter would have got to me if she hadn ' t even put Rome , Italy , on it .	She refolded the letter , replaced it in its envelope , and turned with relief to one from her brother George .	But alas George , when he had written , had only just returned from going to Tuxapoka to Cousin Elec ' s funeral . He was full of heavy family reminiscence . All the fine old stock was dying out , look at the world today . His own children had suffered from the weakening of those values which he and Theresa had always taken for granted , and as for his grandchildren ( he had one so far , still in diapers ) , he shuddered to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them at all . A life of gentility and principle such as Cousin Elec had lived had to be known at first hand .	Poor George ! ! The only boy , the family darling . Together with her mother , both of them tense with worry lest things should somehow go wrong . Theresa had seen him through the right college , into the right fraternity , and though pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls , safely married to the right sort , however much in the early years of that match his wife , Anne , had not seemed to understand poor George . Could it just be , Theresa wondered , that Anne had understood only too well , and that George all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull ? ?	As for Cousin Alexander Carraway , the only thing Theresa could remember at the moment about him ( except his paper knife ) was that he had had exceptionally long hands and feet and one night about one o ' clock in the morning the whole Stubblefield family had been aroused to go next door at Cousin Emma ' s call -- first Papa , then Mother , then Theresa and George . There they all did their uttermost to help Cousin Elec get a cramp out of his foot . He had hobbled downstairs into the parlor , in his agony , and was sitting , wrapped in his bathrobe , on a footstool . He held his long clenched foot in both hands , and this and his contorted face -- he was trying heroically not to cry out -- made him look like a large skinny old monkey . They all surrounded him , the family circle , Theresa and George as solemn as if they were watching the cat have kittens , and Cousin Emma running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming into a white enamelled pan .`` Can you think of anything to do '' ? ? She kept repeating .`` I hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up I ' ll just have to ! ! Can you think of anything to do '' ? ?`` You might treat it like the hiccups '' , said Papa .`` Drop a cold key down his back '' .`` I just hope this happens to you someday '' , said Cousin Elec , who was not at his best .`` Poor Cousin Elec '' , George said . He was younger than Theresa : she remembered looking down and seeing his great round eyes , while at the same time she was dimly aware that her mother and father were not unamused .`` Poor Cousin Elec '' .	Now , here they both were , still the same , George full of round-eyed woe , and Cousin Emma in despair . Theresa shifted to a new page .	`` Of course ( George ' s letter continued ) , there are practical problems to be considered . Cousin Emma is alone in that big old house and won ' t hear to parting from it . Robbie and Beryl tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them , and Anne and I have told her she ' s more than welcome here , but I think she feels that she might be an imposition , especially as long as our Rosie is still in high school . The other possibility is to make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that Tuxapoka is populated with -- Miss Edna Whittaker , for example . But there is more in this than meets the eye . A new bathroom would certainly have to be put in . The wallpaper in the back bedroom is literally crumbling off .'' ( Theresa skipped a page of details about the house .) `` I hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them . I may settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best .'' 	I really shouldn ' t have smoked a cigarette so early in the day , thought Theresa , it always makes me sick . I ' ll start sneezing in a minute , sitting on these cold steps . She got up , standing uncertainly for a moment , then moving aside to let go past her , talking , a group of young men . They wore shoes with pointed toes , odd to American eyes , and narrow trousers , and their hair looked unnaturally black and slick . Yet here they were obviously thought to be handsome , and felt themselves to be so . Just then a man approached her with a tray of cheap cameos , Parker fountain pens , rosaries , papal portraits .`` No '' , said Theresa .`` No , no '' ! ! She said . The man did not wish to leave . He knew how to spread himself against the borders of the space that had to separate them . Carrozza rides in the park , the Colosseum by moonlight , he specialized . Theresa turned away to escape , and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two . There she walked to the far left and leaned on a vacant section of banister , while the vendor picked himself another well-dressed American lady , carrying a camera and a handsome alligator bag , ascending the steps alone . Was he ever successful , Theresa wondered . The lady with the alligator bag registered interest , doubt , then indignation ; ; at last , alarm . She cast about as though looking for a policeman : this really shouldn ' t be allowed ! ! Finally , she scurried away up the steps .	Theresa Stubblefield , still holding the family letters in one hand , realized that her whole trip to Europe was viewed in family circles as an interlude between Cousin Elec ' s death and `` doing something '' about Cousin Emma . They were even , Anne and George , probably thinking themselves very considerate in not hinting that she really should cut out `` one or two countries '' and come home in August to get Cousin Emma ' s house ready before the teachers came to Tuxapoka in September . Of course , it wasn ' t Anne and George ' s fault that one family crisis seemed to follow another , and weren ' t they always emphasizing that they really didn ' t know what they would do without Theresa ? ? The trouble is , Theresa thought , that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter supremely , nothing here is supposed even to exist . They would not care if all of Europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow . It never registered with them that I had time to read all of Balzac , Dickens , and Stendhal while Papa was dying , not to mention everything in the city library after Mother ' s operation . It would have been exactly the same to them if I had read through all twenty-six volumes of Elsie Dinsmore .	She arranged the letters carefully , one on top of the other . Then , with a motion so suddenly violent that she amazed herself , she tore them in two .	`` Signora '' ? ?	She became aware that two Italian workmen , carrying a large azalea pot , were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could begin arranging a new row of the display .	`` Mi diapiace , Signora , ma insomma .'' 	`` Oh put it there '' ! ! She indicated a spot a little distance away .
I knew it as surely as everybody in Westfield -- that Lucille was a husband stealer . You can ' t keep that kind of information quiet in a town of only 4000-plus . And I ' ve been told that just about every town , no matter what its size , has its Lucille Warren .	Just as it has its Susan Dolan , though nobody ' d ever bothered to tell me that . Susan Dolan , that ' s me .	They even talked about Lucille down at the Young Christians ' League where I spent a lot of time in Bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission . I never heard my folks talk about her , though . They were good-living religious people , and I can truthfully say I never heard them spread any gossip about anybody . Even if they ever did say anything about people like Lucille Warren , I know they wouldn ' t have dreamed of saying it in front of me . My folks and my faith protected me from things like that .	And so I was really upset the first time I discovered that my boy friend Johnnie was seeing Mrs . Warren . I asked him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck . I asked him if it was true .	He gave me a straight , honest answer .`` Look , Sue baby '' , he ' d said . Much as I love you -- well , a guy ' s a guy and Lucille ' s willing to -- to come across . Honest , kitten , that ' s all it is -- I don ' t even like Lucille much '' .	I guess it was at that moment that I realized what I was up against in the person of Lucille Warren . But it didn ' t seem fair . My love for Johnnie was young and clean -- how could I possibly compete with a woman like that , who didn ' t hesitate to use her sex .	Johnnie was a trucker with a small lumber outfit in a town about twenty miles away , and he was also pretty good at anything in the carpentry line . It was a vivid , sharp February morning that Johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard , bringing some stuff Dad had ordered . I wasn ' t in the habit of batting my eyes at delivery men , but the moment I saw Johnnie , I knew he was different . He wasn ' t only different -- he was it . He had an easy masculine grace about him , the kind that kids don ' t have , but that I had sometimes admired in other older men . His smile was quick , and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp .	The most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in me , too . I could hardly believe such good luck was mine .	And now Lucille Warren had gotten a look at him . I guess she was between affairs or something , but anyway , she had set her sights on Johnnie , my Johnnie .	I didn ' t like it one bit . But what could I do ? ? A man had to have his release -- at least that ' s what the boys used to say in high school -- and I wasn ' t providing it for Johnnie . Neither was his wife . She wouldn ' t have , even if he ' d asked her .	But he wouldn ' t ask her -- he wasn ' t the kind of man who would force his wife to submit to him against her will . And he wouldn ' t leave her either -- he ' d told me that . He was too honorable to leave his wife penniless and leave those helpless children without their daddy .	Johnnie loved me and wanted me . But the only love I was giving him was the pure kind . It was weeks before we even kissed for the first time .Against my folks ' wishes , we ' d been seeing each other for short rides in the truck . The rides were tame enough -- mostly we talked . But by the time the first crackling of spring came around , we both knew we were hopelessly in love . Yet even then we did nothing much but talk , and maybe neck a little .	`` It ' s so crazy '' , I told him once .`` I always imagined I would probably end up marrying a minister or somebody like that . Somebody with no vices . You know '' .	`` And you fall for a lumber jockey '' .	`` Who drinks far too much '' .	`` And smokes too much '' .	`` And '' , I was ticking off the items on my fingers , `` swears too much and goes out with the boys , whoever they are , too much , and who ever goes to church and won ' t even listen when I try to persuade him to come back to the fold '' .	He examined his nails carefully .`` I could walk out the door '' .	`` Don ' t you dare '' .	`` And never show my face or my truck around here again '' . He still wasn ' t looking at me .	`` You wouldn ' t '' .	`` Or I could visit Lucille Warren '' .	`` You wouldn ' t . Please ! ! You wouldn ' t '' .	He shrugged noncommittally .`` I might '' .	And now he was seeing her . He ' d just admitted it to me . I huddled miserably beside him in the truck . It was all my doing -- his seeing her . Johnnie and I had been innocent in our love , and that was the way I wanted to keep it . At first , Johnnie hadn ' t understood -- how could he , not being a religious person like me ? ? But then he had said , `` All right , kid , if that ' s how you want it , that ' s how it ' ll be '' .	But what had I done , trying to keep us pure ? ? I had driven him into the arms of that scheming woman . I had just the same as delivered him into the hands of the Devil ! !	So one week later , I surrendered to him in the little motel on Route 10 . My very first time . I was desperate to hold him , to give him whatever in this world he wanted or needed , and to keep him from the clutches of Lucille Warren .	And , though at the time I blushed to admit it even to myself , there was in me a growing desire , a sexual awareness , that Johnnie had set in motion , an awareness that no other man had ever triggered . I wanted him , with a terrifying fierceness .	Astonishingly enough , it was my own voice I heard there in the darkness , begging this man to make love to me .	`` Love me , Johnnie '' .	`` I will , kitten '' ! !	Outside , in the summertime fields behind the motel , a thousand crickets serenaded us .`` Will you always love me this way '' ? ?	`` Uh huh . Always '' .	`` Mmm '' . And I snuggled closer to the man I loved .	It was as blissful and fulfilling a night as any bride ever experienced . I had had no wedding ceremony , no witnesses , no certificate of marriage , but I had all the joy that goes with them .	`` Johnnie ? ?	`` It can ' t be wrong , can it ? ? Not really '' .	Johnnie rose on one elbow .`` Stop worrying . It ' s never wrong if love is real '' .	I took great comfort from his words , and smiled to myself in the darkness . Infinite peace , complete contentment . Idiot ' s delight , I later discovered .I felt no conflict between what I was doing and my strict religious upbringing . I had always resisted the passes made at me by other kids , and many times I had thought about my love for Johnnie who , being thirty , brought a maturity to love that the kids around town could know nothing about . I had also thought a lot about how God must look on true love , and so in a way I was keeping my promise to God , my promise to remain pure until I was married .	I was practically a bride , after all .	There would have been a ceremony if it had been possible . Of this , I had no doubt . Wouldn ' t Johnnie do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness ? ? Of course he would . He ' d not only told me so , he ' d proved it . It wasn ' t Johnnie ' s fault that he was hopelessly tied down to that frightful woman who did her best to make his life unbearable . Just because he was honorable enough to want to continue supporting his two children , as any decent man would , that was no reason he should be denied his own small share of happiness too . And if I could contribute to that , I ' d do it . The cost didn ' t matter . No price is too high when true love is at stake .	And I had no doubts about how true this love was . I ' d never even petted with a boy , and after I met Johnnie he never touched me for the longest while , not until I all but threw myself at him . He was plenty attentive , all right , but he behaved like a gentleman , and I figured that , emotionally , I was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half . What could a mere twelve years matter ? ? It wasn ' t , I was sure , a difference in age that came between people , but a difference in maturity .	And hadn ' t I rescued him from Lucille Warren ? ? She ' d have gotten him , if I hadn ' t stopped her . After all , Lucille Warren was a husband-stealer from way back .	But I ' d been a good girl and now God was blessing me with the gift of this magnificent man and the wondrous love we shared . It was only fitting that we seek out whatever joy our union might bring .	`` Love me '' ? ?	`` Uh-huh . Love you '' .	`` Always and always , Johnnie '' ? ?	`` Always '' .	`` Mmm '' .	Convention time in Boston . A chill wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow . From the entire eastern half of the nation they ' d be coming , members of the Young Christians ' League , and I ' d been chosen to represent our chapter .	I had mixed emotions about going . I ' d been seeing Johnnie almost a year now , but I still didn ' t want to leave him for five whole days . But I had looked forward so much to being with this church group . I hadn ' t been doing as much work as I used to in Westfield and I felt funny about that and wanted to work harder than ever . I wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this fine group . So I went to Boston .	The first meeting was held in Faneuil Hall , a great big place where we were able to meet members from all the other states . My cousin Alma , at whose home I was staying during the convention , introduced me to a group of young people from Rhode Island . One of them was a very friendly , lovely fellow named Ronald , a boy about my age with slick , blond hair and dancing blue eyes . He looked very different from Johnnie -- in fact , he looked sort of like me . I thought so , and he mentioned it , and Alma said so too .	After the meeting , there was going to be a party at someone ' s house . I assumed Alma would get me there , but in the confusion of the meeting breaking up , we were separated . Outside the hall , I anxiously looked around for her , then all at once there was a hand on my elbow .	`` Hey , there , beautiful twin of mine '' , Ronald said .`` Need a pumpkin to get to the party '' ? ?	I couldn ' t help laughing with him .`` Well , I should find Alma '' -- I began .	`` Alma , Schmalma . Come along with me '' . I went .By the time we arrived , the party was already going strong . A couple of the girls were laughing rather shrilly and I realized they were drinking . My folks wouldn ' t dream of having alcohol in the house , so my first taste of it had been -- of course -- with Johnnie . I hadn ' t liked it at first -- it was bitter and burning . But when Johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale , I enjoyed it . Of course I enjoyed ' most anything if I did it with Johnnie . Johnnie I suddenly realized he ' d been totally out of my thoughts all evening . But that was only natural , I decided ; ; surely he was still resting snugly in my heart .	`` I don ' t see Alma anywhere '' , I said .	`` She ' s invisible tonight . C ' mon , let ' s find out where they ' re keeping the glasses '' .	I drew back .`` I -- I don ' t think so , Ronald . Not for me '' .	`` Aw , come on '' .	`` No -- really '' .	He shrugged .`` Okay . But at least come along while I get lubricated '' .	The kitchen was jammed . Strange faces , most of them , and I wasn ' t even sure all of them had come from the League meeting .
Under normal circumstances , he had a certain bright-eyed all-American-boy charm , with great appeal for young ladies , old ladies , and dogs . Today , he looked like an Astronaut who had left his vitamin pills on the bureau and spent six months in space : hollow eyes , hollow cheeks , hollow stomach . Breakfast , he thought . A shot of orange juice would make everything seem better . He looked around his little Eden : bureau , bed , table , chair , two-burner stove . Then he remembered .	`` You share a refrigerator '' , Mrs . Kirby had said , and somehow , at midnight , after the long drive from New York in pelting rain , that had sounded reasonable . In the cold light of day , it seemed a lunatic arrangement . Share bath , maybe -- but share refrigerator ? ? She had explained it -- something about summer people ' s eating out and not enough space in the units . And where was the thing ? ? He remembered seeing it last night , when he put away his small store of bachelor-type eatables . Ah , yes -- his half of a refrigerator stood outside , on the `` curving veranda '' between Unit Number Three and Unit Number Four .	It was still raining , and Mrs . Kirby ' s cottages bloomed through the gray haze like the names they bore , vivid blue and green and magenta . Charlie downed his orange juice and one of the long , skinny green pills , his spirits as damp as the day .	This vacation had seemed like a good idea last week , when his doctor had prescribed it .`` Take a full month '' , the doctor had said .`` Lots of sun , lots of rest . The red pills are a vitamin-and-iron compound . This is a sleeping capsule . The others will make you a little more comfortable until you get it licked . You young men get to be my age , you won ' t take flu so lightly '' .	Charlie had accepted the diagnosis without comment . The doctor could call it anything from flu to beriberi ; ; but Charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew , too , that there was no pill to cure it . He had loved and lost Vivian Wayne to somebody else , had watched her marry the somebody else , and had caught a bear of a cold by kissing the bride good-by forever , which was really piling it on . He had caught , too , like an ailment , a confirmed distrust of women . Once burned -- scalded , really , because Vivian had given him every encouragement -- forever shy . From now on , his was going to be a man ' s world : the North Woods , duck blinds at dawning , beer and poker and male secretaries .	Meanwhile , he had this miserable cold , and as he leaned against the refrigerator , watching the rain make sandy puddles at his feet , the doctor ' s prescription for lots of sun seemed like a hollow mockery . In these damp circumstances , he was an odds-on bet to develop pneumonia .	He looked up to see Mrs . Kirby , awesome in a black-and-yellow polka-dotted slicker , bearing down on him .`` Three-day blow '' ! ! She bellowed triumphantly . He had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard really filthy weather as a kind of Pyhrric victory over the tourists .`` Fine , day after tomorrow '' , she added .	`` I hope so '' , he said .`` I ' ve got this cold . Thought I ' d bake it out in the sun '' .	`` Ah '' . She studied him briefly .`` You ' ve got a peaked look . Better get in out of the wet '' .	Charlie forbore to mention that the wet was somewhat universal , Peony being less than weatherproof . As for its being fine , day after tomorrow , he had the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again , with Vivian lost to him forever . He could imagine her at this minute , honeymooning in Nassau with what ' s-his-name , lounging on golden sands , looking forward to a life of unalloyed bliss . All Charlie could look forward to was a yellow pill at noon , a salami sandwich for lunch , and a lonely old age -- if he lived that long .	He leafed through the light reading provided by Mrs . Kirby for her guests : four separate adventures of the Bobbsey Twins ( At the Seashore , At the Mountains , On the Farm , and In Danger ) and several agricultural bulletins on the treatment of hoof-and-mouth disease in cattle , hideously illustrated . He dozed , only to dream of Vivian , and woke , only to crash into the night table , bruising his other shin . He took a yellow pill , only to choke on it , and went for the salami , only to find something alive in the refrigerator -- something pink and fuzzy .	His first thought was that Mrs . Kirby , in her mania for color , had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in ; ; but on further investigation , the thing proved to be a sweater , of the long-hair variety that sheds onto men ' s jackets -- pale , pale pink and , according to the label , size thirty-four . He thought about it for a minute , could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator , got the salami , bread , and a Bermuda onion , and put the whole thing out of his mind .Next morning , he found a note in the refrigerator .`` Would you mind wrapping your onion '' ? ? Said this note .`` The smell permeates everything '' ! ! Everything being the sweater , a lipstick case , and a squirt bottle of Kissin ' Kare pink hand lotion . The note paper was pink , too , and the handwriting small and dainty and utterly feminine . Not that he had supposed , considering the evidence , that he was sharing this refrigerator with a member of the Beach Patrol . He scrawled `` Sorry '' across the bottom of the note and then , against his better judgment , added : `` Don ' t you eat '' ? ? He didn ' t want to encourage anything here ; ; but on the other hand , he didn ' t want her swiping his salami .	`` Not onions '' , came the answer the following day .`` Ugh '' .	Must have really smelled up her sweater , he thought , and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater fast-frozen . But then , as he well knew , women are not guided by logic or common sense . Take Vivian . Yes , take Vivian . Somebody had .	Now , if this were Vivian next door to him and if , for some obscure female reason , she kept her clothes in the refrigerator , they would not be pink . They would be black or white or horse-blanket plaid , chic and splashy , like Vivian herself . Pink , Vivian once had told him , was for baby girls , and grown-up girls who wore pink were subconsciously clinging to their infancy .	`` Why does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator '' ? ? He mused aloud .Eh '' ? ? It was Mrs . Kirby , making her toilsome way along the veranda , laden with a clattery collection of mops , brushes , and pails .`` What ' s that you say '' ? ?	`` Oh , nothing . Just glad the rain ' s stopped '' .	`` Oh , yes . Just look at that sky . Be a scorcher by afternoon '' .	`` I hope so . I ' ve got this cold '' .	`` So you said '' . She scrutinized him .`` My , you ' re peaked . You want to watch out that you don ' t get burned to an ash , first sunny day . I must remember to warn the girl next to you in Larkspur . That pale kind ' s the worst '' .	That pale kind , Charlie thought . Hardly an inviting description . But then , neither was peaked . He could hear Mrs . Kirby now , warning her pale guest against sunburn .`` I spoke to the fellow next door , too '' , she might say .`` He ' s that peaked kind '' .	Surely there was a better word . Charlie looked in the mirror . Run-down , iron-poor . He looked more closely . Frail , feeble -- peaked . Clearly , two damp days with the Bobbsey Twins had done him no good .	The sun , blazing hot as prophesied , was far from kind to Mrs . Kirby ' s varicolored properties . When Charlie came up from the beach for his four-o ' clock pill , the whole establishment ( gaudy enough when seen through mist and fog ) looked like a floodlit modern painting -- great blocks of dizzy color , punctuated at regular intervals by the glaring white of five community refrigerators . This weekend , he thought , he would look around for some more subdued retreat , with Cape roses , maybe , at the door . He could not imagine a flower ' s being brave enough to grow beside Peony , Larkspur , and the rest .	The sweater was gone from the refrigerator , and in its place was a large plastic bag , full of wet pink clothes . No wonder she was so pale , wearing all those cold clothes .	He got a red pill and a beer and then , on impulse , transferred the rest of his salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled `` Be my guest '' on the wrapping . It gave him a good feeling .	`` M-m-m . Thanks '' , was her answer the next day . The note was propped against his pill bottles and bore a postscript : `` You ' re not at all well , are you '' ? ?	`` I ' ve got this cold '' , he wrote . Not that it was any of her business .	`` It ' s none of my business '' , said the next note , `` but my Aunt Elsie used to take lemon juice and honey in hot water for a cold , and she lived to be ninety-six . I mean , she ' s still living , and she ' s ninety-six . Why don ' t you try that '' ? ?	`` I don ' t have a lemon '' . He had to write very small to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper .	By the next morning , she had turned the paper over .`` Gee , neither do I '' .	Charlie grinned . She didn ' t sound like a pale girl . She sounded a little like a redhead . But then , redheads are often pale .	He stuck his head in Mrs . Kirby ' s little rental office .`` I guess that redhead next to me took your advice . I haven ' t seen her on the beach '' .	`` You won ' t , if you ' re looking for a redhead . She ' s got browny hair '' .	He spent that afternoon on the beach , looking for a pale , browny-haired girl in a pink bathing suit . There were pink bathing suits on blondes , and browny-haired girls in red or black or green bathing suits . There were a sprinkling of daring bikinis and a preponderance of glorified tank suits . Up on a dune , he saw a girl , all by herself , sitting on a camp stool before an easel and absorbed in her painting . He paid little attention to her because she was a redhead and because she was wearing white -- one of those bulky , turtle-neck sweaters . On the beach , there were pale girls and not-so-pale girls . And he saw them all as he walked up and down .	At two that morning , he was still walking -- up and down Peony , up and down the veranda , up and down the silent , moonlit beach . Finally , in desperation , he opened the refrigerator , filched her hand lotion , and left a note .`` I ' ve got this sunburn '' , said the note , `` and I used some of your hand lotion . Hope you don ' t mind '' .	`` Of course I don ' t mind '' , she answered .`` You ' re having a miserable time , aren ' t you ? ? Use all the lotion you want , and for goodness ' sake , stay in out of the sun for a couple of days '' .	This was a very warm , sympathetic girl , he decided . Sympathy is a fine quality in a woman . Now Vivian , for instance , was not too long on sympathy . She felt , and said , that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves ; ; it was a tough world , and you had to be tough to hold your own . He didn ' t know what was so tough about Vivian ' s world , slopping around Nassau with what ' s-his-name . Suppose what ' s-his-name got a sunburn ? ? Charlie couldn ' t see Vivian offering any hand lotion . She might peel him , once the worst of the agony was over .Charlie spent the next two days in his pajama bottoms , waiting for the fire in his back to subside , and used generous quantities of the hand lotion .	Correspondence passed back and forth .	`` How ' s your sunburn now ? ? The only thing , this lotion has glycerin in it , and that whitens the skin , so if you ' re so anxious to get a tan , you may not want to use it '' .	`` I ' m not that anxious , but maybe that ' s why you ' re so fair '' .	`` That Mrs . Kirby ! ! I ' ll bet she told you I was puny , too . How ' s your cold '' ? ?	`` Broiled out . She didn ' t say you were puny . Are you ? ? What ' s puny '' ? ?	`` Puny goes with pale and peaked . Do you have anything to read while you ' re shut up ? ? There are two things here about Surviving in the Wilderness , and a book called ' Tom Swift and His Speedy Canoe ' ; ; but the picture of Tom Swift is pretty sinister . Also the canoe '' .
There was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot . The new Riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that took a hop . For a few innings the Anniston team couldn ' t figure him out . Then , in the fifth , Anniston ' s kid catcher caught onto a curve and smacked the ball into left center field . Eddie Lee , Riverside ' s redheaded playing manager , ran after the ball but it rolled past him . Phil Rossoff cut over to center from left field to get the relay . Eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to Phil .`` Third ! ! Third base '' ! ! Eddie shouted . Phil spun around and made an accurate throw into Mike Deegan ' s hands on third base . Mike caught the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag . But the Anniston boy had begun his slide too late . He came into the bag with his body and Mike Deegan brought the ball down full in his face .`` You bastard '' ! ! The Anniston catcher screamed . He jumped to his feet and started to throw punches . Mike Deegan tossed his glove away and began to swing at the catcher . This brought in everybody from both sides , while the spectators stood up and added to the uproar . The fighters were separated in a few minutes . The game was resumed . But Mike Deegan was boiling mad now . When the inning was over he cursed the Anniston catcher all the way into the dugout . Phil Rossoff , coming in from left field , stopped at the water fountain for a drink . Mike Deegan was standing beside it , facing the field . He was eyeing the Anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before the inning began .`` Keep your eyes open , sonny '' ! ! Mike yelled to the catcher .`` You ' re in for trouble '' . The Anniston catcher did not reply with words . He simply turned to Mike and smiled . This so infuriated Deegan that he spun around and said : `` I ' ll get that little bastard . So help me God , I ' ll get him '' .	Phil Rossoff said : `` Why don ' t you leave him alone '' ? ?	`` Mind your own goddamn business '' , Mike Deegan said .	Phil shrugged . He stepped into the dugout , wondering why Deegan was always looking for trouble . Maybe the answer was in his eyes . When Deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips .	In the last of the sixth inning Mike Deegan got up to bat and hit a fast ball over the left fielder ' s head . By the time the fielder got his hands on the ball Deegan was rounding third base and heading for home . The left fielder threw and it was a good one . But Mike had no chance of being tagged . The Anniston catcher was straddling home plate . All Deegan had to do was slide , fall away , but instead , he rammed into the catcher .	Both fell heavily to the ground .	Only Mike got to his feet . He went back to touch home plate , turned and walked to the dugout without looking back .	The Anniston players and their manager ran out on the field . They poured water over their catcher ' s face . He did not move . Then the manager called for a doctor . The Riverside physician came down to look over the injured ballplayer . Then , quickly , and a little nervously , the doctor ordered a couple of ballplayers to carry the catcher into the dressing room .	Mike Deegan was sitting on the bench , watching . When the ballplayers started to carry the catcher off the field he said : `` That ought to teach the sonofabitch '' .	Phil Rossoff , seated next to Deegan , got up and moved to the other end of the bench .	The Anniston manager was coming over to the Riverside dugout . He was followed by four of his men . It began to look as if something was going to happen . Mike sat quietly watching the manager come nearer . Eddie Lee moved over to Mike Deegan ' s side . No one said a word .	The Anniston manager came right up to the dugout in front of Mike . His face was flushed .	`` Deegan '' , the manager said , his voice pitched low , quivering .`` That was a rotten thing to do '' .	`` For God ' s sake '' , Mike said , waving the manager away .`` Stop it , will you ? ? Tell your guys not to block the plate '' .	`` You didn ' t have to ram him '' .	`` That ' s what you say '' .	The Anniston manager looked at Eddie Lee . It was a cold and calculated look . He turned and went back across the field to his dugout . He called in the pitcher who had been pitching , and a big , heavy , powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound for Anniston .	The game started again and in the eighth inning Mike Deegan came up to bat . Everyone in the ball park seemed to be standing and shouting .	The first ball the hefty pitcher threw came in for Mike ' s head . Deegan fell into the dirt , the ball going over him . He arose slowly and brushed himself off . He got back into the batter ' s box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again .	`` Hit the bum '' ! ! Somebody yelled from the Anniston bench .	In the Riverside dugout Frankie Ricco , shortstop , whispered into Phil ' s ear : `` There ' s gonna be a fight '' .	`` Look at those bastards '' ! ! Charlie Haydon , a pitcher , said .`` They ' re looking for trouble '' .	Mike was slow getting into the box this time . When he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in .	`` Listen '' ! ! He shouted to the pitcher .`` One more and I ' m coming out there '' ! !	`` I ' ll be waiting '' ! ! The pitcher yelled back .	Mike Deegan pounded the rubber plate with the end of his bat . He stood flat-footed in the box , but not very close to the plate now . The pitcher wound up and the ball came in straight for Mike ' s head . Deegan dropped , got up , turned and , holding the bat with both hands up against his chest , began to walk slowly out to the mound . The pitcher tossed his glove away and came towards Mike Deegan . They were both walking towards each other , unhurried .	Riverside and Anniston players rushed out on the field . In the next moment , it seemed , the infield was crowded with spectators , ballplayers , cops , kids and a dog . There was much shouting and screaming . Fights sprang up and were quickly squelched . Mike and the Anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together .	Phil Rossoff and two other Riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started .	After the game , Phil was taking off his sweatshirt in the dressing room when Mike Deegan came in .	`` It ' s a helluva thing '' , Mike said , looking at Phil , `` when a guy ' s own team-mate won ' t come out and help him in a fight '' .	Phil sighed and pulled the wet sweatshirt over his head . Frankie Ricco sat down on the bench near Phil . The other players were undressing quietly . Eddie Lee had not come in yet .	Mike went over to Phil and stood over him .`` Why the hell didn ' t you come out when you saw them gang up on me '' ? ?	`` I didn ' t think it was necessary '' .	`` Well ! ! Now that ' s just fine ! ! You didn ' t think it was necessary '' . Mike placed both his hands on his hips . He pushed his jaw forward .`` Listen , wise guy , if you think I ' m gonna do all the fighting for this ball club you ' re crazy '' .	Mike had a good two inches over Phil and Phil had to look up into Mike ' s face .	`` I didn ' t ask you to fight for the ball club '' , Phil said slowly .`` Nobody else did , either '' .	`` You trying to say I started the fight '' ? ?	`` I ' m not trying to say anything '' .	Phil turned away and opened his locker , and then he heard Mike Deegan say : `` You ' re yellow , Rossoff '' ! ! And Phil banged his locker door shut and spun around . But before anything could happen Frankie Ricco was between them and Eddie Lee had come into the dressing room .	`` Phil , come into my office '' , Eddie said .	Phil followed Eddie into the office and shut the door . He sat down before Eddie ' s desk .	`` I ' m doing you a favor '' , Eddie said quickly .`` You get your unconditional release as of today '' .	Phil ' s eyes widened just a trifle .	`` The best thing for you to do '' , Eddie said , `` is go home . You don ' t belong in professional baseball '' .	Phil had to clear his throat .`` Is this because of what happened out there '' ? ?	`` No '' , Eddie said .`` But it does confirm what I ' ve suspected all along '' .	Phil stood up .`` Listen ! ! This is the second time .'' 	`` Sit down , sit down '' , Eddie said .`` I ' m not saying you ' re yellow . I am saying you ' re not a professional ballplayer '' .	Eddie Lee leaned forward over the desk .`` Now listen to me , Phil . I ' m not steering you wrong . You haven ' t got the heart for baseball '' .	Phil shook his head and Eddie frowned . Suddenly his voice grew hard .`` What the hell do you think baseball is ? ? You ' re not in the big leagues , but if you can ' t give and take down here what the hell do you think it ' ll be like up there '' ? ?	Phil started to say something but Eddie cut him short .`` Now don ' t tell me what a good ball player you are . I know you ' ve got talent . But what you haven ' t got is the heart to back up that talent with . The heart , Phil . You just haven ' t got the heart for pro-ball , and that ' s it '' .	Dazed , Phil said : `` I don ' t get it . My batting average '' 	Eddie stood up abruptly , then sat down just as abruptly .`` What difference does your batting average make ? ? Or your fielding average . Or even the way you run bases . I tell you when it ' s necessary to hurt in order to win -- you won ' t do it . That ' s what I mean by no heart for the game . Baseball ' s no cinch . Deegan had no business ramming into that kid out there . He did it because he knows for each guy he puts out of commission that ' s one less who might take his job away later on . What the hell do you think baseball is ? ? A sport ? ? It ' s a way of life , goddamit ! ! And you ' ve got to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody who wants to take your way of life away from you '' ! !	He ' s wrong ! ! Phil thought . It ' s only his opinion . There were other clubs in this league . He stood up slowly . He was a little pale and shaky . His lips felt glued together .	`` I think you ' re wrong , Eddie '' , he said finally .	Eddie nodded .`` Okay . You ' ll get your pay in the morning '' .	Phil turned and left the room , hearing Eddie say : `` Someday you ' ll see I was right '' .	Phil shut the door behind him . Outside in the dressing room , Frankie Ricco sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes .	`` What happened '' ? ? Frankie asked .	Phil said : `` I got my release '' .	`` You crazy '' ? ?	Phil shrugged .	`` What for '' ? ?	Phil sighed .	Frankie shook his head .`` I don ' t get it '' .	`` I don ' t know '' , Phil said .	They were silent for a few moments . Then Frankie said : `` What are you gonna do '' ? ?	Phil started to take his clothes off and Frankie sat down on the bench again . Phil took off one shoe and stared at it .	`` Don ' t take it like this '' , Frankie said .`` Hell , plenty of guys get let out and come back later . The leagues are full of guys like that '' .	Phil was very quiet .	`` What are you gonna do , Phil '' ? ?	Phil did not answer .	`` Why not try another club '' ? ?	Phil looked up . What the hell right did Eddie have saying a thing like that ? ?	`` Springfield ' s in tomorrow '' , Frankie said .`` Talk to Whitey Jackson '' .	He just didn ' t know what he was talking about , saying a thing like that .	`` Will you do it , Phil '' ? ?	`` Do what '' ? ?	`` Ask Whitey for a job '' .	Phil nodded .`` Sure '' , he said .`` Springfield come in tomorrow '' ? ?	Frankie nodded .	`` I ' ll speak to Whitey '' .	`` Atta boy '' .	`` I ' ll talk to him , all right '' .	`` Don ' t worry '' , Frankie said .`` You ' ll get a job there . He needs outfielders bad '' .	`` I ' m not worried about it '' , Phil said .	`` That ' s the way to talk . What else did Eddie have to say '' ? ?	`` Nothing '' , Phil said .
	Richard ' s next interest seemed the product of his insularity . His broad reading took him into certain by-ways of religion and the subject of religion began to fascinate him . When he was twelve he took to reading St . Augustine and Aquinas , then Lao-tse , Confucius , Mencius , Suzuki , Hindu tomes by endless Krishnaists and numerous socio-archaeological papers . For his birthday , because Richard had seen them in a store and asked for them , his mother bought him the Zend-Avesta and a little image of the Indian god , Acala . And one day , on her own , his mother came home with a present entitled The Book of the Dead , which she suspected Richard would enjoy . He was enormously happy with her gift and smiled , then went to his room to read .	At dinner one night , when he was fourteen , Richard announced , `` There is only one god '' .	`` Did you think there were two '' ? ? Grinned his father .	`` You don ' t understand '' , Richard said gloomily .	Through quiet laughter his mother said , `` Don ' t speak to your father like that , Richard '' .	Richard seldom spoke anyhow and he didn ' t speak to his parents about religion again .	His interest in the formal study of religion waned when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in Asian affairs . Although he still didn ' t speak to anyone , he grew fond of saying , `` The future lies in Asia '' , when the opportunity arose , and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to New York to give him a foundation , they said , for his life in Asian studies .	Richard was a solitary student in New York and acquired , in his remoteness , a thorough if bookish knowledge of Asian lore , literature , life , politics and history . He was awarded a fellowship to continue his studies in Tokyo and he packed up his clothes , the biwa upon which he had been practicing and his image of Acala , and left to spend a week at home before leaving the country .	The week at home was not comfortable . His mother , who had seen little of him for four years , appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an Orient which , she herself having slight knowledge of it , had to be distrusted . She seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home , talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested .	`` Do you still have The Book of the Dead '' ? ? She asked him and , laughing , she added , `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you ' d like it '' .	`` Yes '' , he lied to shorten the conversation , `` I still have it '' . He was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject . As for The Book of the Dead , it along with his other books on religion had been incarcerated in a furnace in the basement of the building in which he had lived in New York . He had dusted each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and , trembling at having to open the big furnace , given them up to the flames . Then he sped from the dark basement and returned to his room and cried .	Richard left America with his clothes , his biwa and his image of Acala and , on the freighter which took him to Japan , he plucked at the biwa , trying to make the sounds he wrought resemble an ancient Japanese tune he had once heard . During his second week at sea he brought the curious melody out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure . He stole from his cabin late that night and crept out into a gusty North Pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water . It was so dark that he didn ' t see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it . It was as though the biwa had been eaten up by the wind .	In Tokyo Richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in New York , except that he had replaced his biwa with a friend . An American student named Charlotte Adams had refused to take notice of his evident aversion to people and had at last succeeded in getting him to talk to her . He had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of Tokyo . In Charlotte , Richard saw a frankness and a zest for doing things which , after a fashion , he envied . In time , he grew to depend upon her occasional company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate in more social activity . She convinced him that he ought to be a member of some of the small tea-drinking parties she held at her rooms and in the end he complied with her wishes , although it was only rarely that he added anything to the random conversations .	At one such gathering Charlotte announced , `` I was at Ryusenji today . Have you ever been to Ryusenji '' ? ? No one had .`` Well , it ' s at Fudomae and there was a tan young man , quite naked , taking a shower in the pool . I was thoroughly startled '' .	Richard thought it a more promising remark than any made during the last conversation , but Charlotte ' s manner during the gatherings was more flippant and superficial than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would lead to nothing much better than the pointless words which had preceded it . Three of the four persons present , all foreign students in Tokyo , had been playing a game of judging popular Japanese foods by the In and Out system , an equation in which Zen philosophy was used as the modifier . Soba , udon and tea were In because they could be taken noisily . Sushi was Out because it was pretentious . Sashimi was In , Samuel Burns had suggested , because it was too far Out to stay Out , even if it was a little pretentious . Richard had kept his eyes down throughout the game , the very sound of the chatter nearly painful to his ears .	`` He wasn ' t the least bit disturbed by my watching him '' , said Charlotte .	`` Did you watch him '' ? ? Asked a red-haired girl named Ceecee Witter .`` I shouldn ' t have been able to do that '' .	`` Well I was able to do it '' , Charlotte said with no sign of irritation .`` For a minute , anyhow . I ' m surprised no one has been there . I ' ve been there a number of times . Sam , I thought you knew everything about Tokyo . You ' ve never been to Ryusenji '' ? ?	`` I ' ve heard about it '' , Samuel Burns said .`` There ' s a little place there called Lovers Mound dedicated to Gompachi and Komurasaki '' .	`` Yes , a little parkish place '' , Charlotte said , and concluded , `` Anyhow , it ' s all very nice . And the man who brought sweet potatoes into Kanto is buried there , next to a beautiful seated statue of Fudo . Oh , that ' s what I meant to tell you . This is the interesting part , Richard '' , she had a bothersome habit of trying to pull him into the talking .`` There was that fellow out there in the bitter cold '' -- 	`` My God , it was cold today '' , said Samuel Burns .`` Twenty-two or twenty-three '' .	`` And the water would be still colder '' , Ceecee seemed to shiver at the thought of it .	`` And your golden god '' , said Samuel Burns , `` probably went right home and poured himself into a boiling bath . It would kill one of us '' .	`` But the point is '' , Charlotte said , `` there he was , freezing , naked in a little stream of water at Ryusenji , all in worship of Fudo , the god of fire '' .	Richard ' s dark eyes came up and seemed for the tiniest moment to reflect sharp light . It was true ; ; Fudo , the god of wisdom , was also thought of as the Japanese version of Acala . The conversation went on but Richard stopped listening . He found himself trying to remember something , but he couldn ' t decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall . He had almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of the black Pacific was the memory for which he had been searching . Perhaps he sensed some connection between the incident on the freighter and the ascetic at Ryusenji , he was unable to put it together .	That night , after leaving Charlotte ' s apartment , Richard walked about for a time before returning to his room . When he at last did go to his room , he couldn ' t sleep and instead paced up and down before his little image of Acala , thinking first of Charlotte ' s tale of the man at Ryusenji , then of his biwa and the invisible Pacific waters . And the next morning , not sure of why he went , he took the train to Fudomae and walked to Ryusenji .	He was surprised by the sharp sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which Charlotte had mentioned . He went through a gate to stand at the edge of the water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped from large spigots high at the back of the pool . On the hillside above was caged what might have been an incarnation of Fudo , or perhaps a demon . The strange creature , housed in wire , made him shudder . The sensation he so overwhelmingly realized was one which told him he had been there before but he knew he had not , and could not recall any place he had visited to be likened to the limpid green water or the little fountain-falls or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach .	He left the pool and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple , and the sense of familiarity with the place would not leave him . Into a little well before the temple he dropped a hundred-yen coin and then he had an urge to sound the bell before the temple , to take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle of bronze ; ; but the spirit he wished to call out would not , he knew , come in the person of the temple priest . Instead , he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of stairs and stood before the seated Fudo at their head . The black Fudo seemed to stare rigidly back at him and Richard ' s eyes were caught by the Fudo ' s in fascination , and then Richard was shocked as , all at once , flames shot out from the sharp features of Fudo ' s face and there was a terrible metallic scraping sound , as if the large statue were about to burst from some pressure within it . Then the flames were gone , the stillness fell upon the severe black face and Richard began to tremble violently . Suddenly he emptied his pockets of all his coins and dropped them into the box before the seated Fudo and hurried back down both stairways and away from the temple , never looking back . He walked all the miles back to his room .	He seemed to have picked up a virus that day , because the next morning he had a small cough and felt a bit hot . He stayed home , reading and refusing to think about his frightening experience at Ryusenji . But the process of refusing to think about it was an active reminder in itself and he couldn ' t rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day . The cold lingered , making sleep difficult that night , and he remained in bed still the next morning , now unable to keep from thinking about the inexplicable sight of burning metal , the wretched sound , the unbearable feeling of having been to a remote Tokyo temple at some earlier time in his life . All of the elements of the experience were impossible and yet the reality of them was heavy upon him and he resolved never again to visit the temple at Fudomae .
I was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when I was plowing the stubble field far across the hill from the farm buildings . It had grown hot early that day , and I hoped that the boy , my brother ' s son , would soon come across the broad black area of plowed ground , carrying the jar of cool water . The boy usually was sent out at about that time with the water , and he always dragged an old snow-fence lath or a stick along , to play with . He pretended that the lath was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing , tractor sounds with his lips .	I almost ran over the snake before I could stop the tractor in time . I had turned at the corner of the field and I had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth , and I was thinking of the boy and the water anyway , and when I looked again down the furrow , the snake was there . It lay half in the furrow and half out , and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when I put in the clutch . The tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth , and the tractor stopped instantly .	The snake slid slowly and with great care from the new ridge the plow had made , into the furrow and did not go any further . I had never liked snakes much , I still had that kind of quick panic that I ' d had as a child whenever I saw one , but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful . He was multi-colored and graceful and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only so slightly . Go out of the furrow , snake , I said , but it did not move at all . I pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out , hoping to frighten him with the noise , but the snake only flicked its black , forked tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel , without fright or concern .	I let the engine idle then , and I got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it . My movement did frighten the snake and it raised its head and trailed delicately a couple of feet and stopped again , and its tongue was working very rapidly . I followed it , looking at the brilliant colors on its tubular back , the colors clear and sharp and perfect , in orange and green and brown diamonds the size of a baby ' s fist down its back , and the diamonds were set one within the other and interlaced with glistening jet-black . The colors were astonishing , clear and bright , and it was as if the body held a fire of its own , and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin , vivid and alive and warm . The eyes were clear and black and the slender body was arched slightly . His flat and gracefully tapered head lifted as I looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth .	You beauty , I said , I couldn ' t kill you . You are much too beautiful . I had killed snakes before , when I was younger , but there had been no animal like this one , and I knew it was unthinkable that an animal such as that should die . I picked him up , and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly , and I could feel the coolness of that radiant , fire-colored body , like splendid ice , and I knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart of him , like fieldmice swallowed whole might make .	The body caressed through my hands like cool satin , and my hands , usually tanned and dark , were pale beside it , and I asked it where the fire colors could come from the coolness of that body . I lowered him so he would not fall and his body slid out onto the cool , newly-plowed earth , from between my pale hands . The snake worked away very slowly and delicately and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty , and he carried his head a little above the rolled clods . The sharp , burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil , like a target .	I felt good and satisfied , looking at the snake . It shone in its bright diamond color against the sun-burned stubble and the crumbled black clods of soil and against the paleness of myself . The color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien , too , in that dry and dusty and uncolored field .	I got on the tractor again and I had to watch the plow closely because the field was drawn across the long hillside and even in that good soil there was a danger of rocks . I had my back to the corner of the triangular field that pointed towards the house . The earth was a little heavy and I had to stop once and clean the plowshares because they were not scouring properly , and I did not look back towards the place until I had turned the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field , a long way from where I had stopped because of the snake .	I saw it all at a glance . The boy was there at the lower corner of the field , and he was in the plowed earth , stamping with ferocity and a kind of frenzied impatience . Even at that distance , with no sound but the sound of the tractor , I could tell the fierce mark of brutality on the boy . I could see the hunched-up shoulders , the savage determination , the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels , and the pirouette of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick .	Stop it , I shouted , but the lumbering and mighty tractor roared on , above anything I could say . I stopped the tractor and I shouted down to the boy , and I knew he could hear me , for the morning was clear and still , but he did not even hesitate in that brutal , murdering dance . It was no use . I felt myself tremble , thinking of the diamond light of that beauty I had held a few moments before , and I wanted to run down there and halt , if I could , that frenetic pirouette , catch the boy in the moment of his savagery , and save a glimmer , a remnant , of that which I remembered , but I knew it was already too late . I drove the tractor on , not looking down there ; ; I was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on . My head began to ache , and the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes , and I hated the job suddenly , and I thought , there are only moments when one sees beautiful things , and these are soon crushed , or they vanish . I felt the anger mount within me .	The boy waited at the corner , with the jar of water held up to me in his hands , and the water had grown bubbly in the heat of the morning . I knew the boy well . He was eleven and we had done many things together . He was a beautiful boy , really , with finely-spun blonde hair and a smooth and still effeminate face , and his eyelashes were long and dark and brushlike , and his eyes were blue . He waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up , as he would smile on any other day . He was my nephew , my brother ' s son , handsome and warm and newly-scrubbed , with happiness upon his face and his face resembled my brother ' s and mine as well .	I saw then , too , the stake driven straight and hard into the plowed soil , through something there where I had been not long before .	I stopped the tractor and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me .`` Can I ride around with you '' ? ? He asked , as he often did , and I had as often let him be on the tractor beside me . I looked closely at his eyes , and he was already innocent ; ; the killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his .	`` No , you cannot '' , I said , pushing aside the water jar he offered to me . I pointed to the splintered , upright stake .`` Did you do that '' ? ? I asked .	`` Yes '' , he said , eagerly , beginning a kind of dance of excitement .`` I killed a snake ; ; it was a big one '' . He tried to take my hand to show me .	`` Why did you kill it '' ? ?	`` Snakes are ugly and bad '' .	`` This snake was very beautiful . Didn ' t you see how beautiful it was '' ? ?	`` Snakes are ugly '' , he said again .	`` You saw the colors of it , didn ' t you ? ? Have you ever seen anything like it around here '' ? ?	`` Snakes are ugly and bad , and it might have bitten somebody , and they would have died '' .	`` You know there are no poisonous snakes in this area . This snake could not harm anything '' .	`` They eat chickens sometimes '' , the boy said .`` They are ugly and they eat chickens and I hate snakes '' .	`` You are talking foolishly '' , I said .`` You killed it because you wanted to kill it , for no other reason '' .	`` They ' re ugly and I hate them '' , the boy insisted .`` Nobody likes snakes '' .	`` It was beautiful '' , I said , half to myself .	The boy skipped along beside me , and he was contented with what he had done .	The fire of the colors was gone ; ; there was a contorted ugliness now ; ; the colors of its back were dull and gray-looking , torn and smashed in , and dirty from the boy ' s shoes . The beautifully-tapered head , so delicate and so cool , had been flattened as if in a vise , and the forked tongue splayed out of the twisted , torn mouth . The snake was hideous , and I remembered , even then , the cool , bright fire of it only a little while before , and I thought perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that , and had not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life .	I wrenched the stake out , that the boy had driven through it in the thickest part of its body , between the colored diamond crystals . I touched it and the coolness , the ice-feeling , was gone , and even then it moved a little , perhaps a tiny spasm of the dead muscles , and I hoped that it was truly dead , so that I would not have to kill it . And then it moved a little more , and I knew the snake was dying , and I would have to kill it there . The boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again and he was racing innocently in circles , making the buzzing tractor sound with his lips .	I ' m sorry , I thought to the snake , for you were beautiful . I took the broken length of it around the tractor and I took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit and I struck its head , not looking at it , to kill it at last , for it could never live .	The boy came around behind me , dragging the stake .`` It ' s a big snake , isn ' t it '' ? ? He said .`` I ' m going to tell everybody how big a snake I killed '' .	`` Don ' t you see what you have done '' ? ? I said .`` Don ' t you see the difference now '' ? ?	`` It ' s an ugly , terrible snake '' , he said . He came up and was going to push at it with his heavy shoes . I could see the happiness in the boy ' s eyes , the gleeful brutality .	`` Don ' t '' , I said . I could have slapped the boy . He looked up at me , puzzled , and he swayed his head from side to side . I thought , you little brute , you nasty , selfish , little beast , with brutality already developed within that brain and in those eyes . I wanted to slap his face , to wipe forever the insolence and brutal glee from his mouth , and I decided then , very suddenly , what I would do .
	Cady didn ' t come unglued easily , but this had not been a day of glad tidings . Tax worries , production worries , personnel worries , and the letter from Hanford College , his own alma mater , a real snapper .	Hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years ago . Yes , the boy ' s credentials were in order -- scholastic transcript , character references , picture , health record , successful college boards . But due to the many applicants on file , would he co-operate and write a personal letter giving them his son ' s motivation , interests and his qualifications for leadership ? ?	Cady Partlow lit his pipe with no comfort . This was it . This was the letter which would or would not enroll his son , David , in Hanford . His son who had never held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life . His son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor , lawyer , merchant or chief .	He wondered if he had played it wrong . Maybe he should have kept in touch . Gone back for reunions . But he had been busy building a business , being a big man in his own town just as he had been a big man at Hanford , Class of 1935 . Besides , Cady Partlow knew he wasn ' t the old-grad-type .	It wouldn ' t help anyway . Look at Pete Alcorn , who hadn ' t missed a Hanford ball game in fifteen years . Pete ' s son was rejected . Hanford College , Little Ivy League , had no room for football players with low grades .	Cady looked at his own son ' s scholastic record with pride . Good solid B average with a sprinkling of A ' s in math and science . Imagine his son being that good in science ! ! Mr . Partlow could still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray temples as he remembered what a near thing chemistry had been for him at Hanford . But then , he hadn ' t studied very hard . Getting elected president of the student body took a lot of time and politicking .He put down his pipe and started to type .`` In response to your letter , I can in good conscience recommend my son , David , in the field of leadership '' .	He stopped and looked at the picture of his son , the picture on his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a candidate for Hanford College . He didn ' t have to be told his son looked like him . David had the same gray eyes , high cheekbones , dark hair and a certain rugged ugliness . Height , 6 ' . Weight , 160 . Health , excellent .	He turned back to the typewriter with a little more confidence .`` His interests range from astronomy and geology to electronics , tennis and swimming . His chief motivation for enrolling at Hanford is the desire to '' -- 	Mr . Partlow banged his fist on the keyboard , ruining the letter . He paced to the window and looked at the city he had helped to build .	How do you tell a college president that your son doesn ' t know what he wants to do ? ? That you have refused to drive him into the family business or push him into a profession so you can say at the club , `` Of course David has known since he was twelve he wanted to be an engineer '' -- or a lawyer , or an editor ? ?	How do you tell a college like Hanford that your son has a vast potential , that he will find himself ? ? Just give him time , give him a chance .	Cady snapped the Venetian blind shut and slammed himself down before the typewriter , rolled in a fresh sheet , and gave his letter the same savage attention he bestowed on a salesman who needed to have the bucket taken off his thick head .	What a production to make of a letter commending your own son ! ! His eyebrow went up in amusement at his soul-searching panic . He told Hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics . He told Hanford his son had participated in numerous high-school activities . He belonged to a social club , a civic group , little theater , swimming team , and had been president of the student forum as well as treasurer of the science club .	He finished with a flurry of good wishes to Hanford College and signed the letter . There , that did it . Then he met the grave eyes of his wife , Anne , from the photograph next to David ' s . He shoved the unsealed letter into his coat pocket .	Better show it to Anne and see if he had omitted anything . After all , his wife had written most of his letters for him in those first lean days of Partlow Products . Anne had a way with words . Half of it was natural , half was Smith College .	Yet the whole of Anne was something she had never learned in any college . A woman had it or she didn ' t . Anne had it . She said what she meant and let it be . She never got on his back . He could take the advice or leave it .	He whistled as he locked the office and grinned as he got on the elevator .	`` You look like you just heard a real gasser , Mr . Partlow '' .	Cady looked at Tom , who had taken him up and down for fifteen years .`` I was just thinking how things have changed . When I went to college they begged you to come . Be our guest ! ! It ' s our pleasure ! ! Now you have to be well rounded , firm in motivation and pre-packed with knowledge '' ! !	Tom slid open the door to the lobby .`` That ' s a fact , Mr . Partlow . My John applied to six colleges before he got in '' .	`` Going to State '' ? ?	`` No . He ' s president of the rocket club here , you know . Always messing around with science stuff . Real bright along those lines , you might say . He got a science scholarship to Yale '' .	`` Oh '' , said Mr . Partlow , `` that ' s fine , Tom . Just fine '' .	As he drove home through the thinning traffic , Cady felt the unease growing . He hadn ' t told anyone , but he , too , had applied to five colleges for David . They had all turned down his son . Weakness in leadership . So sorry . Limited interests . So sorry . No clear motivation . So sorry .	He suddenly realized when he walked into his own pretty darned expensive house that he needed the Martini Anne had waiting for him . But tonight his drink tasted like branch water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no surcease from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket .	Nor did looking at Anne ease the tension as it usually did . He liked looking at Anne . Most people did . He liked her blond hair and the sprinkle of freckles across her nose . From those navy-blue eyes she saw things as clearly and honestly as David did . She always could sense the shag end of a woolly day .	`` Board meeting tonight , Cady '' ? ?	`` No , I begged off . Work to do '' .	`` Can I have the car , Dad '' ? ?	`` Why not let him take it , Cady ? ? I know it is midweek , but it ' s only eight days before commencement . Let ' s forget the rules '' .	Cady , deep in thought , neither heard nor answered .David grinned . Carefully he put down his steak knife and said loudly , `` Mr . Chairman '' ! !	Cady Partlow ' s head came up like that of the proverbial fire horse .`` I ' m sorry , Dave . The car ? ? Of course you can have it '' .	Dave ate two pieces of pie as he did everything else , slowly , methodically and with interest .`` Hear anything from Hanford yet , Dad '' ? ?	Cady begged the question .`` Don ' t worry about it , Dave . Your acceptance will come through '' .	Dave shrugged on his sports coat and picked up the car keys .`` Don ' t be too sure , Dad . Charles Burke got turned down by Dartmouth and he is a straight-A student '' .	Anne said it wasn ' t surprising because Charles was antisocial , a lone wolf , and completely one-sided .`` I can hardly say the same about you , Dave '' ! !	Dave kissed her lightly .`` Girls , my dear parent , are here to stay ! ! Get my old man to bed early . He looks a little bit frayed '' .	Anne waited until the door had slammed and picked up the coffeepot .`` Let ' s go into the library . You do seem somewhat tattered '' .	Cady trailed her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable book-lined room .`` I didn ' t know I looked so dilapidated '' ! !	`` Wrong word , darling . Your fur has been rubbed the wrong way and you show it . Need any help '' ? ?	`` In a way , yes . Hanford College hasn ' t decided on Dave ' s application yet . They want a letter from me on his motives , interests and leadership . Here ' s what I wrote '' .	Cady handed her the letter , drank his coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was belligerence . Already he could feel Anne ' s questioning eyes .	`` I know you wrote this in a hurry , but , Cady , Dave was only acting president of the student forum for a few days . That was when half the school was down with flu '' .	`` But he was president '' .	`` And he wasn ' t really elected treasurer of the science club . He just took over the week Bill Daley was in the state basketball play-off '' .	Cady stuck his jaw out .`` The fact remains he was treasurer '' .	`` And the swimming team . No , Cady , he made second team . Just missed the first '' .	`` A team is a team '' , insisted Cady .`` Anything else '' ? ?	`` Yes '' , she said quietly .`` I don ' t think you ' ve been quite honest , Cady . It isn ' t like you . David ' s interests . Astronomy . He was mad about stars at the age of nine . Geology , You and Dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the fishpond six years ago ! ! Those aren ' t his interests now '' .	`` What do you suggest '' ? ?	`` Just say he likes swimming , tennis , chess and music '' .	`` Music ! ! He hasn ' t been to a symphony concert all season '' .	Anne smiled .`` But he plays bass with Chief Crazy Horse and his Five Colts '' ! !	`` You mean that rock-and-roll combo ? ? Even in that he never solos like Jack on guitar or Rich on sax . He ' s -- he ' s just there , that ' s all '' .	`` Yes , he ' s just there . He keeps the beat going . He likes to play bass because he doesn ' t have to solo . He doesn ' t like to rise and shine . Don ' t worry , Cady , he ' ll be back in the Beethoven fold by next year '' .	Cady appeared slightly mollified .`` All right . But I refuse to be brutally honest and mention Chief Crazy Horse and his Five Colts '' .	Anne laughed and Cady felt the tension loosen its grip on the back of his neck .`` Maybe I am padding it a bit , Anne '' , he said .`` But you know how hard it is to get a boy into a good college . He has to have leadership as well as grades '' .	Anne folded the worrisome document .`` Did you know he is advertising his ham-radio equipment for sale this weekend ? ? He hasn ' t used it now for several years . Can you really say his motivation for college is electronics '' ? ?	Cady felt the jolt as though he had stepped off the curb on his heel .`` And what would you say he wants to do ? ? Just what '' ? ?	`` It ' s Dave who is applying to Hanford College . Why don ' t you ask him '' ? ?	For once Cady Partlow wished Anne would yell at him so he could yell back .`` I have talked to him , but you know I ' ve never tried to push him into any profession . I won ' t be guilty of trying to run his life '' .	Anne picked up the towel she was hemming for the hospital guild .`` Just because your father tried to make a banker out of you , you ' ve leaned over backward to keep your hands off . But subconsciously you ' ve wanted him to conform to your mold . You want him to be a leader of men , like you '' .	Cady put the well-worn chip back on his shoulder .`` Dave has qualities of leadership . He just hasn ' t developed them yet . Give him time '' .	He never will , Cady . Not the kind of leadership you mean , working with lots of people . All your wishful thinking won ' t change that . Remember what you used to say in the Army ? ? You can ' t run a war with ninety-nine generals and one private '' ! !	Cady walked the block to the mailbox , almost ashamed of himself for arguing with Anne .
	Martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to exist at all . And once begun , had grown to such monstrous proportions . The pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life .	Lying awake at night , he could see them , laid out on the floor of his mind . When he rose in the morning , the image was still there .	He had always been a messy and negligent man . In his bachelor days , his bedroom had been strewn with clothes which his mother , or later the hotel maid , generally saw fit to put in order . No doubt Dolores resented following in their footsteps .	But it was fun those first days , kidding about the trail of garments he left littered across the rug . There was an assertive maleness in his grinning refusal to pick them up . Half slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things .	He remembered the first time he saw her , standing across the room at a party . The smooth curve of her neck , very white against hair which curled against it like petals . Her hair was the color of those blooms which in seed catalogues are referred to as `` black '' , but since no flower is actually without color contain always a hint of grape or purple or blue -- he wanted to draw the broad patina of hair through his fingers , searching it slowly for a trace of veining which might reveal its true shade beneath the darkness .	So he sought her out , and spoke to her , and thought of his hand in her hair . Or against her back , pressed on the column of vertebrae , which held her so magnificently straight and unyielding , until the segments of bone made tiny sharp cracking noises , like the snapped stem of a tulip .	But , to put it bluntly , nothing snapped . Yet that had not seriously troubled him , not then . They married . More he could take at leisure . All Martin thought he needed was time : to what better use could time be put ? ?	He saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly . There was too little occasion beforehand for resistance , the brave strong delights of emotional clash and meeting . They had left themselves too much to discover .	But , at the start , his new life felt invigorating . Good .	It was on the tenth day after the wedding ( how could it have been so soon ? ?) that he dropped the shorts on the floor .	`` Now , I ' m not going to pick up those shorts '' ! !	Martin gave her a teasing pat .`` I think you ' ll get tired of them there '' .	In the morning the shorts were where he had left them . He smiled to himself , and decided not to mention them till Dolores did . It was almost too easy . For he had just remembered : tonight they were having their first guests . The shorts would not be on the floor when he came home that evening .	He was wrong . The rest of the bedroom had been groomed to a superhuman neatness , but in the middle of the carpet lay the disheveled shorts . They gave the room a strange note of incongruity , like a mole on a beautiful face .	He saw that Dolores intended to wait until the last minute , thinking he would get nervous . Quietly he determined to foil her . I can be as stubborn as she can , he thought ; ; my nerves are as strong . She ' ll rush to the bedroom when the doorbell rings .	It rang . Ten minutes early .	Martin was standing a few feet from the front door . He swung around , eyes toward the bedroom , some fifteen feet away . Dolores stood motionless in the doorway .	He could not cross the living room , brush past her , and bend down to retrieve the shorts .	Martin turned his back . He strode to answer the bell .	Bill ' s hat was deposited in the hall closet . With the most casual and relaxed manner in the world , Dolores led Anthea to the bedroom . Martin strained his ears .	At first he could not be sure . Then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there . A glissade of giggles slid over their voices .	All evening Anthea favored him with odd , coy looks . Clearly she had been instructed `` not to say a word '' . For some reason , this ellipsis in the conversation spread until it swallowed up every other topic . At last there was a void no one could fill . The Brainards went home early .	Martin realized , later on , that he should have `` had it out '' with Dolores that night . As violently as possible . But he was so taken aback , he could not believe any rage of his would make her give in . On the contrary , it would only weaken his position if he fumed , while she stayed calm and adamant . And if he surrendered after raving at her . He shivered .	Suppose he ran up the white flag altogether ? ? At once . He considered the sober possibility .	In his head was the echo of those titters with Anthea .	There was something about private feminine whisperings which always made him feel scabrous and unclean . He remembered his mother gossiping with her neighborhood women friends , lowering her voice to a penetrating hoarseness which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs , where he crouched listening . He could even recall the last time he sat there . She was talking about him that time , because he had done some bad thing , something she disliked , but `` Afterwards Martin said he was sorry . He apologized so sweetly , I couldn ' t keep being annoyed with him '' . It wasn ' t even true that he ' d said he was sorry that time ; ; he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadn ' t happened , which was as honest as he could put it . But his mother told the story over and over , till her `` Martin said he was sorry '' was as much a part of her as the shape of her thin , pallid ears .	The battle had to be fought . Let the best sex win .	But his resolution hardly seemed to help . If the situation had been bad , it now got worse . About this time people began `` dropping in '' , considering that the newly married had been left alone long enough . Angrily Martin wished they had delayed the wedding and gone on a trip -- preferably one that lasted months -- instead of deciding not to postpone the date until he could get away . Here they were at the mercy of anyone who chose to come by . These stray people nearly always insisted on Dolores showing them around the apartment . Of course , the tours of inspection included the ever-present shorts .	It was curious how the different visitors took this . Some tried to ignore the blot on the bedroom ' s countenance . Others asked . Quite a few laughed . To them all Dolores told a lighthearted and witty tale .	`` It ' s a little contest Martin and I have '' , she would begin gaily , carrying the anecdote through a frothy and deceptive course . While he waited in the living room .	Once Martin went along . They entered the bedroom , and Dolores said nothing . Then one of the guests showed his merriment .`` You were in a hurry , weren ' t you '' ? ? Martin would have liked to break the man ' s neck . Dolores smiled ; ; she let the interpretation stand . Now Martin heard himself give a snort of mock good nature . With her eyes Dolores dared him for the truth , ready to begin : It ' s a little contest -- 	Never again did he enter into the ritual of showing the apartment .	They kept up a rigid pretense of speaking relations . But Martin seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything . What to talk about ? ?	Dolores kept picking up any of his clothes ( except the fatal shorts ) which he left about , but he had been robbed of pleasure in scattering his possessions . He fell into the habit of putting his clothes in drawers and closets , so his life might impinge as little as possible on hers . The shorts alone remained .	In his moments of worst agony , Martin imagined what his friends were saying . The sound of their amazement . Bizarre : He could hear the word . The most bizarre situation . We were up to visit them and 	He had thought her exactly what he wanted . Six weeks of marriage and I ' m using the past tense , he told himself furiously . Pursuing his idea , he saw that it would be impossible to leave her now . Everyone would know why ; ; he would cut a supremely ridiculous figure .	He was trapped .	Day and night Martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made for himself . His mind scurried frantically , seeking an exit . Alternately he had periods of hostile defeatism in which he determined sullenly , morosely , to live out his life in this fashion . Nothing would change , nothing would ever change .	When the solution finally came to him , one night while he was in bed , he was so shaken by its simplicity that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to him before .	In a frenzy of excitement , he considered his plan .	Beside his shorts , he would place something of hers .	Instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable moral victory , for if she picked up , say , a pair of her panties , she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside -- the expenditure of energy was almost the same . He felt that it would be a particular humiliation to Dolores to pick up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor . Furthermore , he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly : every time he went in the bedroom , he could drop a slip or a brassiere , or maybe a girdle , next to his shorts . Sooner or later , Dolores would crack . On the other hand , if she didn ' t remove her own things , it would be difficult to explain to the parade of guests which traversed the apartment .	Martin guessed that Dolores would not be so eager to tell the next installment of her story . The tale , he thought , would become less gay . She had used his rumpled shorts as the very image of his childishness , his lack of control , his general male looseness , while she remained cool , airy , and untouched , the charming teacher who disciplined an unruly body . To have her underclothes linked with his on the floor would draw her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd .	Something in the back of his mind was aware that the magnificence of the plan lay in his faith , that the idea would work because he believed in it , since his courage and virility were involved , because it was truly his . The knowledge kept him from analyzing his scheme to death , and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of exalted fanaticism .	The next morning , while Dolores was out of the room , he went to her bureau drawer , took out a pair of nylon lace pants , and tenderly dropped them next to his shorts . He sat down on the bed .	In a surprisingly short time , Dolores appeared . To his delight , her eyes focused at once upon the two garments . Slowly and deliberately she reached down and touched the lace with her fingers , then hesitated for about a second . Ah , he thought , she ' s going through the chain of reasoning which says she might really just as well pick up my shorts too . He saw that in a moment she had grasped all the implications of a plot which had been weeks in occurring to him . Extending her fingers another inch , she caught up the shorts , and swiftly left the room . She did not look at him , but he noticed that her face was flushed and her eyes unsteady .	They breakfasted together , but Martin did not refer to his triumph , and Dolores found a great deal to do in the kitchen , bobbing up and down from the table so that talk was impossible . Well , Martin thought , That ' ll save . He left for work in high spirits .	As he relaxed that day , Martin realized how tense he had been these past weeks . He found that he no longer hated Dolores ( he knew how much he had hated her ) , and he was surprised at a resurgence of an affectionate feeling .
	`` Good old A-Z '' , Cap said .`` You know , I ' ve got one of your cars at home . As a prominent industrialist , you ought to be interested in his nibs ' support group . Isn ' t his racket down your alley '' ? ?	Once it was , William thought . But not any more .	A rush of memory swept him back , and he forgot Cap . How did he start on such a ride to brief glory ? ? Simply enough , through the inadvertent agency of his brother-in-law . General Hershey ' s draft and Doc Eddyman and Cap were responsible for his first eminence , but Fearless Freddy Bryan could take credit , if he cared to ( and he did ) , for the second time . Freddy needed a job , having been detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and skyscraper financing by Gerry , and it was up to Arthur Willis to provide him with one .	Mr . Willis bought Zenith Plastic Products , a skeleton corporation of sorts which had undergone many vicissitudes and whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on Long Island engaged in working out government contracts , and installed Freddy in an executive position . Shortly after , Freddy had his usual proliferation of bold ideas . Willis listened patiently , and once in a while William was exposed to them at a family gathering ; ; he generally heard Freddy ' s suggestions without interest , being absorbed by his own prospering concerns .	Probably Mr . Willis was influenced toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for his grandchildren . Gerry began to aid Freddy with her father , prodded , no doubt , by Joan ' s open contempt for Freddy and William ' s irritating competency . Another factor must have been the eventual disposal of Willis ' fortune ; ; she unquestionably assumed that the more he was entwined with Freddy , the more likely he was to reward Freddy richly upon his death .	Whatever the reasons , Willis and Bryan started expanding Zenith . They acquired another electronics factory , a specialized ceramics company , an organization that built -- very experimentally -- high-speed research calculators . Since they were hunting for national defense contracts , Adam Herberet , a man of surprising resources , entered the combination as a silent partner because of his political connections .	Feeling his power , Freddy looked for additional worlds to conquer . Heavy industry , slanted toward inexhaustible government coffers , attracted him . The Allstates Auto Company , a medium-sized firm which manufactured four-wheel-drive vehicles and other off-road equipment , had recently constructed an over-large , modern plant in a burst of misguided optimism . Cursed with a shaky management and dissatisfied stockholders , it was ripe for amalgamation , and Freddy ' s instinct was to keep growing by stock mergers and small expenditure of cash , and never mind inevitable consequences . With Herberet ' s blessing , he was convinced that Allstates ' Wisconsin folly would be ideal for conversion to airplane sub-assembly , tanks , missiles or ordnance of some kind .	At that point William came into the picture . Although not much desiring the account , he had been appointed advertising head of Zenith . Freed of routine by having his own firm and a complaisant partner , his work in New York had given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate structure ; ; and if he wasn ' t entirely committed to what he did , he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider opportunities . Mr . Willis , eager to have him allied with the family , wanted advice beyond the confines of his field , and William set out on a serious study of the situation , including trips to Wisconsin and Washington .	In the end , he said : `` I ' m not enchanted by the proposition , sir . I know a guy named Jack Hamrick , a very bright young engineer who was with Chrysler , and I took him with me to Allstates . It ' s his expert opinion that the plant isn ' t well suited to what you have in mind . The conversion will cost a fortune . Besides that , I ' m acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through my contacts in the Air Force . I think Adam Herberet is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side . Missiles have thrown everything up for grabs , and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here . The future of manned aircraft is in doubt , which affects government procurement , and jet transports have revolutionized the airline trade -- one jet can take the place of three compound-engine planes . This means the aircraft companies are going to tear into the government market , looking for anything they can get and making the competition tough . Here are a few facts and figures I ' ve assembled . Can ' t you stay with what you have and wait till the dust settles '' ? ?	Willis glanced at the bound pages given him and shrugged .`` Well '' , he said , `` there is Freddy , you know . And Gerry . Freddy is deeply committed to our plans already . He assures me he has people to handle the money raising , and Ham Richert , my lawyer , says the legal aspects of the wedding of Zenith and Allstates are no problem . I don ' t like to exhibit the deadly dampening effect of an elderly man ' s caution '' .	`` Yes , I appreciate that . I wish you wouldn ' t tell Freddy I ' m lukewarm ; ; I ' ve caused him trouble before , and he ' s beginning to resent me . If we don ' t take care , the sisters will be entering the fray on opposite sides , brandishing their cudgels '' .	`` Which is a frightful prospect , Bill '' . Willis laughed .`` One shouldn ' t mix commercial affairs with patriarchy , but in this case I have no choice . Let me think about it . I ' m most grateful to you , so grateful I wish you were my principal aide instead of Freddy '' .	Not to William ' s surprise , Freddy , Adam and Hamilton Richert prevailed ; ; allied to them was Gerry , devoting much time to swaying her father , and Joan dismissed all thought of the project and William was unwilling to interfere further . Zenith absorbed Allstates , stock transfers were arranged , and Freddy became president of the hyphenated combination . Through Jack Hamrick , William fell into the world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for Shoals and Clay .	He forgot about A-Z till , unhappily , he and Hamrick were proved correct . Freddy ' s backing dropped away from him and Mr . Willis was forced to make up the deficit . Adam , beset by changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the new corporation , couldn ' t deliver from his end . The Wisconsin plant turned out to be a white elephant . Stock Willis held in abundance fell sharply in value . Confronted by a grim future , Freddy lost his nerve and plumped for a drastic liquidation .	Once more Willis summoned William .`` You were right '' , he said -- `` you and your engineer -- and I ' m in something of a bind . Freddy ' s solution doesn ' t appeal to me . In addition to other defects , I ' m a stubborn man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment . Will you see if you can help me '' ? ?	William spent a long week end closeted with Hamrick . His recent experience in motor car advertising , a love for cars of themselves , the existence of A-Z ' s useless Wisconsin set-up , exposure to exciting conceptions of Hamrick ' s that nobody would buy , and the coincidental recent failure of a respected but out-dated small-car manufacturer called Ticonderoga Motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid to broach it . Initially , Hamrick ' s reaction to A-Z going into the passenger car market was discouraging . He thought the financing , the advertising , the production of new models , the founding of a nationwide chain of dealerships was simply too difficult . Then he caught fire . If A-Z could buy Ticonderoga cheaply and use their presses and dies and other equipment , if William could hit precisely the right promotion note , if the money hurdle was not insurmountable .	They took nearly a month to investigate , marshal statistics , and put their arguments down in black and white . Taking Hamrick with him , William went to Mr . Willis . He was surprised and dubious , but impressed by the engineer and the report .	`` Your alternative is breathtaking '' , he said , `` and , I ' m frank in saying , a bit mad . I wish I was younger and less timid . Well , I can ' t resolve this myself . I ' ll have to call in the brain trust . Are you willing to run the gantlet ? ? I can ' t guarantee you a sympathetic audience '' .	`` We ' ll be in there swinging '' , William said , `` but in a way , sir , you ' ve got to decide it yourself . You have the controlling interest and the principal expenditure is yours -- and , besides , nobody else is going to have the courage . If they follow anyone , it ' ll have to be you '' . He paused .`` I should explain : there ' s more here for me than advocating my little dream , there ' s you . You mustn ' t take a fall , or publicly back away . I hate that . You ' re -- you ' re Arthur Willis . Forgive the hearts and flowers theme '' .	`` I rather like the music '' , Willis replied quietly .`` Thank you '' .	At the meeting , attended by Freddy , Richert , Herberet and the A-Z executive staff , with Mr . Willis presiding , William and Hamrick did indeed run the gantlet . From shock and incredulity , most of the listeners went on to open resistance and animosity .	`` Oh , my God '' , Ham Richert said , `` a little child shall lead them . Move over , General Motors '' .	`` It ' s absurd , Bill '' , Freddy said , from a pale face .`` You ' re leading Dad down the garden path '' .	`` Your garden , God damn it '' ! ! William said .	`` I don ' t enjoy family quarrels '' , Adam said .`` Nor crazy relatives . We ' re here to transact business . Can ' t we put an end to this , Arthur '' ? ?	`` Hear me out , please '' , William begged .`` I ' m an advertising hustler , I admit , but I have to get hot once in a larger sphere . Sure , Ticonderoga went broke in the low-priced market bucking the Big Three . Their cars weren ' t small enough , they didn ' t have the power , they were old-fashioned . They tried to sell ' em on economy and simple merit . We ' ve arrived at an age for romance and snobbery . We ' ve all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine age . Look what those little European jobs are doing . We ' ll woo the consumer with a product , not bludgeon him with chromed excess length and weight . Let ' s make it moonlight and the call of far places and a seduction , at reasonable rates . Ticonderoga folded a few minutes too soon , before the tide changed , still honest and stupid -- and the network of dealers the company had is around waiting to be signed up again -- waiting for us , ready-made . We ' ve got rid of the steam yachts and Georgian houses , and the bloated , too-expensive automobile is next . Why not come down smartly in the world , in a chic fashion , with an Allstates-Zenith '' ? ?	He swayed them somewhat , but the debate raged on . Financing emerged as the main obstacle . Mr . Willis made it evident that he had contributed his maximum .	`` Nobody will underwrite it , I ' m telling you '' , Freddy said .`` I know what I ' m talking about in that department '' .	`` There ' s plenty of risk money '' , Ham Richert added , `` but not for anything this risky '' .	`` All right '' , William said .`` We ' ll try to swing the deal on that basis . If we can ' t raise the capital , we ' re through . Nothing has been lost . You ' re up against it anyhow . Why won ' t you give me a chance '' ? ?	A silence fell . Heads instinctively turned in Willis ' direction . He smiled at William and slowly rubbed his hands together .	`` I feel I must answer the question '' , he said , `` since the onus later , if any , should fall on me -- I don ' t relish recriminations spread broadcast outside my family . I ' m not giving you a chance , Bill , but availing myself of your generous offer of assistance . Good luck to you '' .	`` All the in-laws have got to have their day '' , Adam said , and glared at William and Freddy in turn .	Sweat started out on William ' s forehead , whether from relief or disquietude he could not tell . Across the table , Hamrick saluted him jubilantly with an encircled thumb and forefinger . Nobody else showed pleasure .Spike-haired , burly , red-faced , decked with horn-rimmed glasses and an Ivy League suit , Jack Hamrick awaited William at the officers ' club .`` Hello , boss '' , he said , and grinned .`` I suppose I can never expect to call you ' General ' after that Washington episode '' .	`` I ' m afraid not '' .
