With history standing astride beginnings industrial revolution Brown & Sharpe singular monument mechanical foresight founder Joseph R Brown world-renowned synonym precision progress metalworking technology .	Joseph R Brown grew bustle enterprise New England 1810 1830 He exposed mechanical world youth helped father David Brown master clock watchmaker plied trade At age 17 apprentice machinist shop Walcott & Harris Valley Falls Rhode Island following jobs quick succession graduation business 1831 lathes tools This enterprise led father-and-son combination beginning 1833 name D Brown & Son business eventually grew modern corporation call Brown & Sharpe .	The Joseph partnership father numbered In 1838 devastating fire gutted shop soon thereafter David Brown moved west Illinois settling land grant declining .	Joseph Brown continued business quickly rebuilding establishment lost fire beginning steps establish pioneer raising standards accuracy machine shop practice throughout world .	Much genius course sprang familiarity clock movements During repair watches clocks building special clocks church steeples formed occupation He particularly graduating precision measurement 1840 thinking lines developed considerably period But business grew told Mr Brown found increasingly difficult devote time creative thinking inclinations led desire It pleasure relief September 12 1848 Joseph Brown momentous entry job book characteristically cryptic style Lucian Sharpe day apprentice .	The apprentice apparently Mr Brown third apprenticeship Lucian offered partnership firm company J R Brown & Sharpe entered period development Mr Sharpe arrival business indeed provide Mr Brown coveted -- time tinkering opportunity carrying developments precision graduation time .	By 1853 partnership announced precision vernier caliper fruit joint efforts The basic significance invention helped follow rapidly 1855 development unique precision gear cutting dividing engine That development formed foundation significant expansions -- gear cutting circular graduating index drilling fields accuracy paramount requirement .	Throughout careers Mr Brown Mr Sharpe setting standards measurement mechanical trades Several efforts direction survive day Brown & Sharpe wire gage system eventually adopted American standard common .	As development followed company reputation precision graduating field brought broader broader opportunities expansion precision manufacture In 1858 partnership manufacturing Willcox & Gibbs sewing machine .	As story goes Mr Gibbs originally counties Commonwealth Virginia illustration magazine famous Howe sewing machine Curious built crude model wood filed piece steel succeeded metal pickup thread enabling crude machine stitches When model solution Howe sewing machine operated told wrong discovered amazement Howe Machine unknown detail threads perfected Thus invented single thread sewing machine Mr Gibbs partnership Mr Willcox decided bring Brown & Sharpe proposal company undertake manufacture .	The boon partnership value particularly stimulation provided imagination J R Brown developments production equipment .	The turret screw machine Brown & Sharpe hand screw machine takes ancestry directly Mr Brown efforts introduce equipment simplify manufacture sewing machine Mr Brown additions arts screw machine design drastically improving means revolving turret introducing automatic feeding devices stock reversible tap die holders .	In 1861 Mr Brown attention called basic production -- manufacture twist drills At time Civil War Union muskets manufactured Providence drills drill hand-filed rattail files This process neither satisfied urgent production schedules Mr Brown imagination possibilities situation The child Mr Brown famous Serial No 1 Universal Milling Machine archtype descended universal knee-type milling machine throughout world The original machine bearing famous serial exhibition Brown & Sharpe Precision Center Providence .	During Civil War period Mr Brown invented Brown & Sharpe formed tooth gear cutter basic invention ultimately revolutionized world gear manufacturing industry changing basic economics Up time cutters gear teeth sharpening As soon time re-sharpening precise form gear tooth lost cutter This process economical manufacture gears questionable found permit repeated re-sharpening gear tooth cutters loss precision form Mr Brown invention achieved byproduct formed cornerstone Brown & Sharpe position leadership gear equipment field lasted 1920 superceded methods .	The micrometer caliper common workshop tool owes J R Brown Although Mr Brown inventor French idea typical intuition conceived importance mass producing basic tool So Mr Brown Mr Sharpe French tool exhibition Paris 1868 brought sample United States started Brown & Sharpe field retains leadership day .	The final achievement Mr Brown mechanical career runs close importance development universal milling machine That achievement creation universal grinding machine appearance 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition This machine milling counterpart antecedent machine-family day precision metalworking shops throughout world Along J R Brown major developments universal grinding machine profoundly influential setting course Brown & Sharpe .	Following Mr Brown death forward Brown & Sharpe organization contributed greatly development company One Samuel Darling .	As head firm Darling & Swartz Mr Darling challenging Brown & Sharpe keenest competition 1850 60 In 1868 truce called companies partnership Darling Brown & Sharpe formed Between buying Mr Darling 1892 portion company precision tool business carried name Darling Brown & Sharpe day precision tools bearing famous trademark .	Perhaps outstanding standard bearer Mr Brown tradition accuracy Mr Oscar J Beale mechanical genius closely paralleled Mr Brown particular forte development exceedingly accurate measuring machinery enabled Brown & Sharpe manufacture gages products accuracy exceeding available elsewhere world .	Also Brown & Sharpe scene century Mr Richmond Viall Works Superintendent company 1876 1910 Mr Viall possessed remarkable talents leadership development He ardent champion Brown & Sharpe Apprentice Program personal counselor countless able developed industrial talents company In sense Brown & Sharpe products company subsequently industrial eminence throughout nation abroad .	Commencing death Lucian Sharpe 1899 name Henry D Sharpe 50 closely interwoven destiny company During presidency company physical plant enormously expanded length breadth Brown & Sharpe machine tool line world During century Brown & Sharpe Providence unchallenged largest single manufacturing facility devoted exclusively precision machinery tool manufacture world .	During company product line followed basic tenets laid Mr Brown It expanded hand screw machines automatic screw machines simple formed-tooth gear cutting machines gear hobbing machines contract gear manufacturing business rudimentary belt-driven universal milling machines broad line elaborately controlled knee-type manufacturing type milling machines In grinding machine field expansion universal grinders cylindrical grinders surface grinders wide variety special semi-special models .	In 1951 Henry D Sharpe Jr succeeded father continued company development major factor metal-working equipment business The company broadening line active major fronts .	The Machine Tool Division currently producing Brown & Sharpe single spindle automatic screw machines grinding machines types knee bed-type milling machines Recently added Brown & Sharpe turret drilling machine introduces company entirely field tool development .	In Industrial Products Division company manufactures markets wide line precision gaging inspection equipment machinists tools -- including micrometers Vernier calipers accessories .	In Cutting Tool Division principal products include wide variety speed steel milling cutters mills saws
